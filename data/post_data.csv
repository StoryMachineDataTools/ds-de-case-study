Christian Bruch,2025-09-05 11:28:36,Text + Album,post,,2887,57,91,"Big day in Nuremberg. 🏭We just laid the foundation stone for a major expansion of our Siemens Energy transformer factory – a €220 million investment that will create 350 new jobs and boost production capacity by 50%.The demand for large-scale transformers is surging globally – and for good reason. These aren’t just heavy pieces of engineering. They quietly keep our energy systems running: by adjusting voltage levels, they allow electricity to travel efficiently across long distances, stabilize grids and support the resilience of increasingly flexible energy systems.A great example of how Germany stays competitive – when business and politics take joint responsibility. 🤝 Thank you to Dr. Markus Söder and the Bayern.de | Bayerische Staatsregierung for backing this expansion and for joining us on site.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369692927280766977

It’s denser than lead, resistant to extreme heat, and nearly impossible to bend or break. That makes it ideal for radiotherapy, where precision is critical. But shaping it into something as delicate as a treatment component? That’s no small feat.At our Kemnath site in Germany, our team developed a fully automated process to do just that—transforming raw tungsten into ultra-thin, movable “leafs” that help steer radiation beams directly at tumors while protecting healthy tissue. These leafs are a core part of Varian radiotherapy systems. Each one is only millimeters thick, but the precision they enable can make a life-saving difference.Since launching the new production line, output has tripled—with no compromise in quality. Every component gets a digital fingerprint that tracks when and how it was made, down to the smallest detail. That kind of traceability ensures consistency, safety, and faster repairs when needed.It took smart engineering, close collaboration across disciplines, and a clear focus on what matters most: improving care for a world without fear of cancer.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369384139176792065

Without it, you don't stand a chance!From my point of view, curiosity is the most important tool in the age of Artificial Intelligence. Why?The best technology is of little use if we are not prepared to keep an open mind and constantly want to learn. The real key skill for dealing with AI is our own attitude.That's the reason why I was really looking forward to attending our Talanx AI Campus to have another dive deep into the world of AI. A great format to give free rein to your own curiosity. I know I'm still learning, so it was an inspiring workshop where internal and external speakers opened up new perspectives with exciting insights and best practices.From my perspective, AI is two things at once, most overhyped and underestimated. However, after 30 years in the profession, I see AI as a game changer in our professional life, if it can be scaled. And therefore a challenge for us all.Challenges are opportunities. Something new is a lever for constant further development. Old certainties do not help us when requirements and technologies are constantly changing.Curiosity is the force that changes everything.It is only through our curiosity and willingness to keep learning that we can seize opportunities. This attitude makes the difference - not just for the individual, but for the entire organisation.Thank you Jan Myszkowski & team for the excellent organisation of the AI Campus, which truly adds value to the organisation.What skills do you feel are crucial for the question of how to scale AI successfully?",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369297800427257861

But how do we secure this future when high energy prices, fragile supply chains and global uncertainties threaten our competitiveness? A key part of the solution: we need to accelerate the Hashtag#hydrogen economy with joint forces. In my keynote at the Hashtag#HySummitRheinRuhr 2025 in Duisburg, I showed why hydrogen is no luxury – it is the backbone of industrial Hashtag#transformation. It enables heavy industry to decarbonize, renewable energy to be stored and transported, and Europe to reduce dependencies. Without hydrogen, there will be no clean and resilient energy system in Europe.  That means we need decisive action now:▶️ Faster Hashtag#infrastructure build-up across Europe: Pipelines, import terminals, and ammonia crackers must move from planning to reality – within years, not decades.▶️ Competitive Hashtag#prices and volumes: Only through joint European demand, functioning markets, and clear frameworks will hydrogen become affordable. We must also strengthen production across Northern and Southern Europe – from Scandinavian wind to Iberian sun – to reduce dependencies and secure resilience.▶️ Pragmatism in Hashtag#transition: CO₂-low hydrogen and gas must serve as bridging solutions until sufficient green capacity is available. At thyssenkrupp, we are both driver and enabler of this transformation. We understand ourselves as part of a strong European network that builds resilience through collaboration, innovation, and strategic alliances – and we are ready to move forward together.▶️ The Hashtag#directreduction plant at thyssenkrupp Steel in Duisburg will be one of the largest hydrogen consumers in Europe.▶️ With thyssenkrupp rothe erde, we deliver large bearings for Hashtag#windturbines that generate the renewable power needed for hydrogen production.▶️ With thyssenkrupp nucera, we deliver world-scale Hashtag#electrolyzers – over 600 projects, more than 10 GW installed capacity.▶️ With thyssenkrupp Uhde, we are shaping the future of global hydrogen transport through Hashtag#ammonia and cracker technologies. The summit has once again shown how important such platforms are – they create momentum by bringing politics and industry together. My thanks go to Hy.Region.Rhein.Ruhr e.V. for fostering this dialogue and action. My takeaway from the insightful exchanges: If we act now, hydrogen will safeguard jobs, prosperity, and Europe’s technological leadership. But this transformation will only succeed if politics, business, and society pull together – to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of a Hashtag#climateneutral and competitive future. Let’s turn the key – and make hydrogen the backbone of a resilient Hashtag#Europe.📸: Bernd Thissen",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7368545068804218880

And I’m glad it did. A job in insurance is a dream job! Insurers help people and businesses in the moment of truth. Insurers provide innovation and growth. And hardly any two jobs are alike. Our job profiles are very diverse. We are home to over 100 professions, like risk engineers, lawyers, actuaries, sales professionals, psychologists, IT specialists, doctors, etc.As different as we may be, our purpose unites us all:👉We help people secure their homes, protect their health, retire without fear, help in case of an accident or the death of a loved one. 👉We strengthen communities by speeding up recovery after crises.👉We empower businesses to innovate, grow, and take bold risks. In Germany alone, insurers are the largest institutional investors, with €1.9 trillion in capital. As technology, climate, and global dynamics reshape our world, our role as stabilisers and enablers will matter more than ever, making us the backbone of our economy and society.Working in insurance isn’t “just a job.” It’s purpose.

While the European Union plans to invest €20 billion in AI gigafactories and data centers, this hardware-focused approach is a misguided solution to the wrong problem. It will be the application of Al that creates demand for massive computing power, data centers, and advanced chips.  This is why instead of subsidizing cloud infrastructure, public investment should flow directly into applied AI and the software solutions that create tangible competitive advantages for European businesses. That is the critical challenge that Europe’s competitiveness and digital future depend on.  I shared more of my thoughts on this important topic in The Economist.

Bernd Montag,2025-08-25 11:10:35,Text + Video,post,,181,3,4,"As summer winds down for some of us, perhaps we can enjoy a bit of breathing room to catch up on our reading lists and reflect – not just personally, but also on the events and decisions shaping our world. Lately, and against the backdrop of the increasing deterioration of ethical standards and the rule of law in more and more parts of the world, I’ve been drawn to real-life stories that explore how democracies evolve, what leaders do in tough situations, and how societies respond to change. I’d like to recommend three books* that offer valuable insight into the development of politics, and the ongoing struggles we face today. Together, they encourage us to take the time to look at these issues in depth and really consider how democracy works – rather than rushing to conclusions – so that we can better protect it. 📖 “𝗘𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘂𝗻𝗴” (𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟰) 𝗯𝘆 𝗪𝗼𝗹𝗳𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗮𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗲: First, it’s crucial to understand where we come from. In his autobiography “Erinnerung,” Wolfgang Schäuble reflects on living through important political decisions in Germany from the post-war period and reunification to the traffic light coalition. It’s an insightful look on where Germany stood 50 years ago, as well as a glimpse of Schäuble’s personal life outside of the German parliament. 📖 “𝗙𝗿𝗲𝗶𝗵𝗲𝗶𝘁” (𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟰) 𝗯𝘆 𝗔𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗹𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗹: A fitting follow-up is “Freiheit” written by Angela Merkel, the first female German chancellor who held that position for around 16 years. She gives a detailed look behind the scenes of national and international decision-making, covering not only a multitude of crises, but also prosperity and key periods leading up to the present day. 📖 “𝗟𝗲𝘁𝘇𝘁𝗲 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲” (𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱) 𝗯𝘆 𝗥𝗼𝗯𝗶𝗻 𝗔𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿: If you’re looking for a timely exploration of today’s political debates, Robin Alexander’s “Letzte Chance” is a thought-provoking read. In covering current events like the climate crisis, the debate on migration, the new era in foreign policy, and the growing polarization of politics, he offers a comprehensive insight on the necessity of democracy – all while encouraging the reader to look towards the future.---  *𝘛𝘸𝘰 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘴𝘦 𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘭𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘤𝘶𝘳𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘭𝘺 𝘢𝘷𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘺 𝘪𝘯 𝘎𝘦𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘯, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘪𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶’𝘳𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘧𝘭𝘶𝘦𝘯𝘵, 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘺’𝘳𝘦 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘩 𝘬𝘦𝘦𝘱𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘯 𝘦𝘺𝘦 𝘰𝘯.

So, let me share my approach to sleep today 😉First things first: I'm a morning person.However, my workload doesn't always allow for that. That's why I would describe myself as a flexible morning person who ensures my body gets enough sleep. This also holds true when I am traveling. I am lucky that I can always sleep anywhere, including power naps on the way from one appointment to another. I kindly communicate my need for a few minutes of silence to any accompanying colleagues during these power naps 😀My Sleep Schedule:On a non-travel week, I usually go to bed between 10:00 pm and midnight. My alarm clock – I use an app that wakes me up with my favorite songs – starts playing (not ringing!) between 5:00 am and 6:00 am.When traveling, I try to adapt to the local time zone on the day of arrival, regardless of how long I’m staying in that particular time zone. I try to stay awake as long as possible so I get good sleep on the very first night. I avoid napping in between. And I don’t break my exercise routines while traveling. This helps me stay energized during the day and get good sleep at night.My Sleep Habits:I try to avoid checking my inbox just before I go to bed, because sometimes I cannot avoid letting open items linger in my mind, which prevents me from getting good sleep.All in all, I don’t aspire to be one of those ""I only need 5 hours of sleep""-people. Sleep scientists say that every human needs a minimum of 7 hours of good sleep. Less sleep cannot be made up for with a single long night of sleep. Consistently getting less than 7 hours of sleep can cause health issues and negatively impact your performance and behavior.How do you ensure you get quality sleep, even with a busy schedule?

Um das zu schaffen, investieren wir jedes Jahr Milliarden in Ausbau, Modernisierung und Digitalisierung unserer Verteilnetze. Gerade in den letzten Jahren hat die Summe der Anschlussanfragen massiv zugenommen. Auch meine hier in den vergangenen Wochen geteilten Standortbesuche haben mir gezeigt, wie sehr unsere Regionalversorger von Anschlussbegehren überflutet werden. Übrigens sowohl von Anträgen auf mehr Einspeisung als auch mehr Last – je nach Region.Das ist erfreulich, hat mich aber auch nachdenklich gemacht: Leider treiben viele dieser neu zugebauten Erneuerbaren (v.a. Photovoltaik) die Kosten für alle Kunden in die Höhe, ohne dass sie die Energiewende aktuell voranbringen. Denn ihnen stehen unverhältnismäßig hohe Systemkosten durch die Netzintegration und/oder zu wenig regionale Nachfrage entgegen. Und leider belasten auch viele der Großbatterien das Netz zusätzlich, anstatt es zu entlasten, weil ihr Standort nach Rendite für den Investor und nicht nach Nutzen für das System gewählt wurde. Auch das führt letztlich zu mehr Kosten für alle Kunden.Daher mein Fazit und meine Botschaft an den Gesetzgeber: Wir brauchen die Flexibilität, regional sinnvoll zu priorisieren, statt stumpf eine zufällige Reihenfolge an Projekten abzuarbeiten!

Wir alle sehen, wie schwer es geworden ist, in unserem Land Dinge wirklich zu bewegen. Alles ist eingesponnen in ein Netz aus Regulierung, Bürokratie und Gesetzen und einem Pluralismus an Stimmen. Das gibt zwar Sicherheit – aber verhindert oft die dringend nötigen Verbesserungen.Umso wichtiger ist es, wenn Menschen den Mut haben, sich einzubringen. Mein Bruder Jan Hoettges tut genau das: Er kandidiert als Oberbürgermeister für Solingen. Ich finde es großartig, wenn jemand Verantwortung übernimmt und in einem schwierigen Umfeld etwas bewegen will. Kommunen sind das Rückgrat unseres Staates. In neun von zehn Fällen, in denen Bürger vom Staat etwas brauchen, ist die Kommune zuständig. Sie registriert Geburten, meldet nach Umzügen um, prüft Anträge beim Hausbau oder zur Hilfe bei der Pflege, berät bei Unternehmensgründungen und Weiterbildungen.Und trotzdem: Prozesse dauern oft länger, als sie müssten. Viele Kommunen sind noch längst nicht so digitalisiert, wie sie es sein könnten. Genau das ist der Punkt, über den wir beide gesprochen haben: unsere Heimat Solingen, digitale Zwillinge – und die Frage, wie Kommunen endlich digitaler werden.Vier Hebel können viel verändern:1. Konsequent digitalisieren. Alles, was digitalisiert werden kann, muss digitalisiert werden. Nicht nur dort, wo der Bürger es sieht, sondern durchgängig im Verwaltungsprozess. Das spart Zeit, Arbeit und Geld.2. Standards schaffen. Ein Hund ist ein Hund. Hundesteuer, Ausweis, Ummeldung – vieles ist überall gleich. Einheitliche digitale Lösungen würden hier Entwicklungsarbeit sparen, Fehler reduzieren und Wartung vereinfachen.3. Digitale Zwillinge nutzen. Erst Verkehrsflüsse digital simulieren, dann die Straße bauen – das vermeidet böse Überraschungen und spart Ressourcen.4. KI einsetzen. Bürger brauchen schnelle, verständliche Antworten. Chatbots können genau das leisten: 24 Stunden am Tag, sieben Tage die Woche.Glasfaser ist das Fundament. Beim Glasfaserausbau arbeitet die Deutsche Telekom bereits mit Kommunen in der ganzen Republik zusammen – von Freiburg bis Flensburg, von Soest bis Solingen. In den allermeisten Fällen gelingt das partnerschaftlich. Die Unterstützung der Kommunen ist dabei entscheidend, denn nur so können wir Tempo machen. Mehr als elf Millionen Haushalte können heute schon Gigabit-Geschwindigkeiten buchen.Wenn Kommunen digitaler und mutiger werden, profitieren wir alle – Bürger, Unternehmen und die Gesellschaft insgesamt. Mein Bruder bringt alles mit, was es für Veränderung braucht.

There's fascinating material science behind this everyday innovation - a perfect example of smart chemistry in action. 👉 Plastic photochromic lenses contain light-responsive organic dye molecules that act like tiny switches. Under ultraviolet (UV) light, they change shape – a process called photoisomerization – so they absorb more visible light and the lens darkens. When the UV exposure fades, the molecules return to their original form and the lens becomes clear again.👉 Temperature matters: When it’s warm, the thermal back-reaction that undoes photoisomerization speeds up (Arrhenius behavior) and the plastic is more flexible, so molecules revert sooner – lenses don’t get as dark and clear faster. In the cold, that back-reaction slows and the matrix stiffens, so more molecules stay in the dark form – lenses reach a deeper tint and take longer to return to clear.👉 While photochromic technology was first developed back in the 1960s, modern versions react faster and perform more reliably across different temperatures.This example is what drives my passion for materials science: not just the complexity behind it, but how it quietly improves life's simple pleasures. 🙂",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7363938018195324928

Hearing directly from the experts from multiple hospitals like Fudan University, East Normal China University, and Shandong University was a real privilege. I was also excited to connect with Prof. Wang Jian’an and the team at Zhejiang University No.2 Hospital in Hangzhou. Their work exemplifies how digital solutions and AI are being pioneered in hospitals through collaborations with both large multi-national companies and local start-ups. It was great to see our local remote cath-lab solutions in action, as well. Prof. Wang is at the forefront of applying the newest technologies in the most challenging clinical scenarios. His national lab for cardiovascular devices offers many examples, including photon-counting CT, which is already benefiting cardiologists daily. Additionally, Prof. Wang is partnering with us on the first clinical application of our pioneering 4D ICE ultrasound catheter for multiple cardiac applications. I left Hangzhou impressed by what we have achieved together, and at the same time, convinced that we are just at the beginning of much more to come. This trip also marked what I hope is the first of many to come: a showcase of our Innovation Center activities with local start-ups. As part of our global innovation network—alongside hubs in Germany, India, and Türkiye—the Center connects experts to co-develop solutions that address both global and local healthcare challenges. Hearing updates on our joint projects in China and the impact they’re starting to make for providers and patients was very rewarding.Thank you to all my conversation partners for the lively exchanges so far!

Es sind viele wichtige Themen adressiert. Positiv ist das klare Bekenntnis zu einer deutlich kostenbewussteren Energiewende, die uns auf dem Weg zur Klimaneutralität hält, und gleichzeitig bezahlbar ist. Denn zusätzlich zu Nachhaltigkeit geht es auch um Versorgungssicherheit, Kosteneffizienz und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Dazu passt auch der neue Fokus auf eine bedarfsorientierte Energiesystemplanung und der erkennbare Versuch, mehr Pragmatismus zu wagen und wirklich Bürokratie abzubauen.Jetzt kommt es auf die Umsetzung an. Dem geduldigen Papier des Koalitionsvertrages müssen jetzt konsequente Taten folgen:➡️ Es sollte nur gebaut werden, was gebraucht wird: Denn eine reine Ausrichtung an politischen Plan-Zielen treibt die Kosten der Energiewende unnötig in die Höhe.➡️ Das, was gebaut wird, sollte mit minimalen Systemkosten umgesetzt werden: Zum Beispiel dürfen heute immer noch Erneuerbare wild zugebaut werden, auch dorthin, wo es gar keine Nachfrage gibt und die Netze schon am Limit sind.➡️ Subventionen können massiv gestrichen werden: Das gilt für viele Erneuerbare-Technologien, die längst wirtschaftlich sind und für alle Maßnahmen, die die Energiewende teurer machen.➡️ Und wir sollten auf Flexibilität setzen: Denn das spart teuren Infrastruktur- und Kraftwerksausbau und steigert die Versorgungssicherheit.Taten braucht es auch auf der regulatorischen Seite. Denn die Energiewende braucht Milliarden an privatem Kapital. Das geht nur mit einem zukunftsfähigen, regulatorischen Gesamtsystem. Und als zwingenden Teil davon eine Verzinsung, die den Erwartungen des Kapitalmarktes entspricht. Und genau hier sehen wir aktuell großen Handlungsbedarf für die kommende Regulierungsperiode:- Bei der Verzinsung von Eigen- und Fremdkapital- Bei den methodischen Änderungen im Effizienz-Benchmark - Bei den Redispatch-Kosten- Und beim InflationsausgleichWenn hier nicht dringend nachgebessert wird, wird es nicht mehr ausreichend privates Kapital geben, um weiter in gleicher Geschwindigkeit in die Energiewende in Deutschland zu investieren. Wir sind weiter optimistisch, dass es eine tragfähige Lösung geben kann.

Alarming statistics about the corrosive effects of partisanship undermine growth and further widen the polarization gap, a vicious cycle that damages the economic wellbeing of our customers and shareholders.Unity is the bridge to prosperity, creating fertile ground for trust and a foundation for economic and societal strength. It overcomes challenges with optimism and creates alliances that bring people together. And what better way to bring people together than through sport? The winners of our inaugural Unity Awards demonstrate the real-world impact of unity in action through sport to foster belonging, inclusion and meaningful change in our own communities: 🏅 In the UK, Anel van der Merwe creates inclusive sport sessions tailored to children with disabilities, establishing one of the few family-centered environments where ability is never a barrier to play.🏅 In Spain, Rosa Sanchez built football teams for migrant youth, offering not just sport but valuable pathways to social integration, leadership, and trust in a new country.🏅 In Egypt, Sara Moamen Abdelsamie and the Dreamers team (pictured) uniquely combined trauma-informed coaching with mentorship to help displaced youth heal and rebuild confidence through sport.I'm inspired by how the heroes recognized in our Unity Awards brought communities together by focusing on what unites us. Our winners will receive custom jerseys and monetary support for their club to build upon the powerful initiatives underway to strengthen inclusion and address local social challenges.

In the global AI revolution, four things matter: data, computing power, capital, and speed. The U.S. has hit the turbo button, China is stepping on the gas – and Europe? Europe presents the world with a 144-page document, charmingly numbered 32024R1689. Since August 2, AI model providers are required to disclose the data used for training – as mandated by Articles 53 and 55 of the handy companion document. The so-called AI Act aims to build trust, promote transparency, and steer innovation. But what is well-intentioned risks becoming a brake on innovation in practice.Because the spirit in which this regulation was born is not one of progress, but of caution – shaped by mistrust towards technology, market players, and its own ability to lead. The obligation to disclose training data, the categorization into risk classes, the lack of international alignment – all of it sends a clear signal: Europe doesn’t trust its own innovators. Of course, artificial intelligence needs clear guidelines. But they should be driven not by fear, but by curiosity, responsibility, and confidence in our ability to harness this technology for good. If we shape AI in Europe from a defensive position, we risk losing not only speed, but also talent, capital, and international relevance. Deutsche Telekom is, of course, implementing the AI Act – with an interdisciplinary team of experts who have ensured security and data protection for years. But the trust we place in technology, responsibility, and progress is something we would also like to see coming from Brussels.

This strong performance demonstrates that we are delivering on the strategic ambitions and financial targets that we shared at our Capital Markets Day. We are progressing from being a world-class product provider to also winning on services that customers value and trust. The problems of our customers are Allianz’s problems – and lessening the financial fears they feel lies at the heart of our purpose as a company.

Our conversations focused on three key areas: Hashtag#portfolio, performance, and the greentransformation. We shared our vision for the future of thyssenkrupp. The spin-off of TKMS is progressing at full speed, with preparations for the Annual General Meeting in August well on track. At thyssenkrupp Steel, we’re driving the business plan forward with focus and alignment, while the restructuring has already begun. On the Hashtag#performance side, we’re heading in the right direction. We have a clear view of where action is still needed and are taking the necessary steps. Effects from our performance program APEX 2.0 are becoming more and more visible – the expanded transformation in our automotive segment is just one concrete example.

Die wirtschaftliche Zukunft Deutschlands hängt von einer starken, nachhaltigen und bezahlbaren Energieinfrastruktur ab. Das 500 Mrd. Euro Sondervermögen der Bundesregierung spielt dabei eher nur eine unterstützende Rolle. Für das Sondervermögen müssen klare Prioritäten gesetzt werden, um den Ausbau effizient und wirkungsvoll voranzutreiben. Für den Ifo Schnelldienst durfte ich einen Gastbeitrag zur Rolle des Sondervermögens schreiben. Ich möchte hier einige Botschaften aus dem Artikel mit Ihnen teilen: ➡️ Bis 2045 sind in Deutschland über 300 Mrd. Euro für Stromverteilnetze nötig, europaweit steigen die Investitionen bis 2050 auf jährlich 67 Mrd. Euro. Die Herausforderung liegt im Zusammenspiel von Erzeugung, Verbrauch und Infrastruktur in einem komplexen System. ➡️ E.ON plant bis 2028 Investitionen von 43 Mrd. Euro, mehr als doppelt so viel wie 2021, und verzeichnet steigende Netzanschlüsse, was den beschleunigten Ausbau bestätigt. ➡️ Um die enormen Investitionen in die Stromnetze zu stemmen, brauchen Netzbetreiber vor allem einen Regulierungsrahmen, der Investitionen und Innovationen in die Energieinfrastruktur fördert und nicht abwürgt. Die Verzinsung der Investitionen muss im internationalen Vergleich wettbewerbsfähig sein, sonst fließt das Kapital in andere Märkte. ➡️ Leider sehen wir momentan das Gegenteil: durch die aktuell im Raum stehenden Änderungen der BNetzA im sogenannten NEST-Prozess drohen Netzbetreibern erhebliche zusätzliche Belastungen. Eine Entwicklung, die die entscheidende Rolle der Verteilnetze für Deutschland schlicht ignoriert. Von den 500 Mrd. Euro Sondervermögen fließen 100 Mrd. an Länder, und der Bund plant bis 2029 150 Mrd. Euro auszugeben, mit etwa 10 Mrd. Euro jährlich für den Klima- und Transformationsfonds, was die Handlungsspielräume einschränkt. ➡️ Staatsgelder allein reichen nicht aus; sie sollen vor allem privates Kapital anziehen, um Innovationen und Ausbau zu fördern. Die Netzinvestitionen werden durch regulatorische Rahmenbedingungen und Bürokratieabbau unterstützt. Das Sondervermögen schafft Spielräume, aber der Staat muss zusätzlich gezielt Impulse setzen, private Investitionen fördern und sich auch mal zurückhalten, wenn er nicht gebraucht wird.

These three aspects are important if you want to become a business virtuoso:🎯 Discipline Virtuosos work with great discipline and perseverance to reach operational excellence. No pain, no gain.💬 Value-based attitude Virtuosos are building bridges to people by having a value-based attitude. It’s this attitude that amplifies operational excellence. 🔥 Passion Virtuosos inspire people with their passionate engagement. Passion pushes us to leave our comfort zone, to innovate and to grow courageously but prudently. Felipe also spoke about work-life balance.

The power system here isn’t just big – it’s one of the most complex in the world, linking remote generation to distant demand across more than 40,000 kilometers of transmission lines. And right now, it is undergoing a transformation as big as the grid itself. For decades, coal has done the heavy lifting. But that era is coming to a close. Most coal plants are set to retire by the mid-2030s – and wind, solar, and also gas are stepping in fast to fill the gap. The challenge is not only generating clean energy – but getting it where it needs to go. If the grid extension cannot keep up, there will be areas, where the majority of the available wind and solar power could go unused by the end of the decade. Not because the wind isn’t blowing or sun shining – there is plenty of both here – but because the grid cannot carry it. I have spent the past week in Sydney and Melbourne, meeting with partners, policymakers, and our own team to discuss how we at Siemens Energy can help strengthen the grid and the generation system reliably.

In my opinion labels are an expression of lazy leadership! Here’s why.Some young people are driven by purpose. Others are seeking security and stability. The same goes for older employees, too. Some older employees resist change. Others drive it. The same is true for young people, too.People are individuals. Not walking age groups. It is not the year you were born that defines you, but who you are and what is important to you. The real problem isn’t the difference between generations that data suggests—it’s our assumptions about differences.When we rely on assumptions and labels, we practice lazy leadership—and miss out on who people really are, what their strengths are and what they value. True leadership is not about reading research on people in the workplace, telling people what to do, wearing suits or flying first class. True leadership begins with active listening!

We celebrated ourselves, and we were also celebrated a little: 200,000 Telekom employees worldwide.Who would have thought that the authority called Telekom would once become a modern company? Growing from 37 million to over 300 million customers worldwide? Increasing revenue from 34 billion to 116 billion euros? And rising from number six to the most valuable telecom company in Europe?Our journey has been one of transformation and design. It has been about decision-making and action. But above all, it has been about people. Like Ron Sommer, who visionary opened up new markets. Or Kai-Uwe Ricke, who took Telekom out of debt and made new investments possible. Or my friend René Obermann, who, like no one else, put our customers at the center of our operations. Most importantly, it has been the many Telekom employees who are with us today or who once were. Those who never gave up. Those who continually reinvented themselves and our company, even in the face of headwinds. Change has also left wounds.

We, too, must reinvent Telekom every day. AI represents a significant revolution. If we use it wisely, we will become even more efficient, customer-oriented, and faster. Hopefully: unbeatable.My highlight yesterday was the unveiling of the ""Gran elephant dret"" by Miquel Barceló.

It’s great reconnecting with renowned experts and colleagues to reflect on how far we’ve come since installing our first clinical system there. When we first started working together, many of the applications we rely on today were still on the horizon. Scans were slow, the experience for patients was often uncomfortable, and image quality was a far cry from what we expect now. Together, we were motivated by the possibilities to shape this field and so, we started pushing boundaries early on. For example, our work on real-time MRI in the 80s helped lay the groundwork for what we now know as minimally invasive, image-guided procedures. These helped make interventions safer and patient recovery times shorter. Then, thanks to various breakthroughs in the following decades, 3D imaging became reality, scans got faster and more precise, and images became clearer and more detailed. Because of contributions from partnerships like ours, MRI turned into what we know today: a quicker, more comfortable experience for patients, and a powerful and versatile tool for providers to screen, diagnose, and treat with confidence. It’s been an exciting journey of transforming 𝐛𝐨𝐥𝐝 ideas into solutions used around the world. In many ways, we’re just getting started. We’re already exploring what’s next in precision imaging, AI-driven workflows, and scaling innovations across entire fleets of scanners.A heartfelt congratulations to the team of experts at Case Western and Siemens Healthineers who have made these 40 years so meaningful.

It focuses on protecting capacity and modernizing investments while coordinating across EU member states and tackling trade challenges. If implemented, it can move Europe from analysis to action - finally.And there's more: The ""Action Plan"" fosters affordable energy, drives innovation with new fiscal incentives, simplifies and reduces regulation, and takes a reasonable, science-based approach to PFAS.I particularly appreciate that Ursula von der Leyen is pushing this package forward at unprecedented speed. Because: timing is everything. With mounting global pressures, we must implement these measures swiftly and pragmatically. The chemical industry stands ready to turn her vision into reality.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348748610152349698
Christian Klein,2025-07-09 12:26:42,Link post,post,,484,14,14,"These days, there is a lot of debate about what hashtag#Europe needs to be more competitive, more agile, and more resilient. hashtag#DigitalSovereignty is one topic that often comes up in these conversations, but to fully understand its impact on Europe’s future, we also need a clear and common definition of what it means.At its core, digital sovereignty means having control over your data and digital infrastructure. It cannot mean complete isolation. We live in a world of tech dependencies that need to be considered. Even when European companies run data centers, key components – like processors and networking gear – still come from other parts of the world. And further up the technology chain, many European businesses are using non-European software solutions. Pushing for complete independence would mean banning all tech from outside Europe – both hardware and software – something that would hurt our economy and slow down innovation.What we need instead is a holistic understanding of digital sovereignty in Europe – one that focuses on self-determination, mutual dependencies, and de-risking, not isolation. We need control over critical technology and data – but in a way that allows us to use the best technologies available, no matter where they’re from. This is possible – if Europe works together.The next wave of hashtag#AI innovation will not be at the layer of the infrastructure. Our strengths lie in what we can build on top of that infrastructure. Great AI is about great input and great use cases – and Europe is in a unique position to deliver on these with huge amounts of domain data, deep industry expertise, and very exciting AI startups. We need revised regulatory frameworks in Europe that support this kind of innovation instead of holding it back.Read more of my thoughts on this important topic here (German only): https://lnkd.in/epGfHaed",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7348689052889440257

So, I thought I’d share a few things that keep me on track, even if I have a quite packed agenda and as day-to-day schedules change 😉 On intense business trips like last week's ASEAN tour, maintaining routines becomes even more crucial. My rule? The busier the schedule, the more important the workout and discipline becomes. Workouts Most importantly, you must make sure that workout sessions are part of your schedule. Don‘t leave anything to chance! I start the day at 5:30 a.m. (if schedule allows 6:00 am 😉), afterwards straight to the gym, with weights, HIIT training like jumping rope in between sets. (Fun fact: I helped design Siemens’ fitness facilities — and as a post-pandemic hobby, built the jump ropes myself! I am a new customer to hardware store's electric cable section 😉). Healthy meals I’m strict about what I consume. Just as AI is only as good as its data, you’re only as good as what you put into you body 😉 Pizza is off the table for more than a decade, egg-white omelets and low-fat yoghurt are on. I find lower carbs and higher protein set me up for sustained energy throughout the day. That said, I do enjoy some cake and sweets, too! Tried many of them during the ASEAN trip. Remember: „The dose makes the poison“  Staying energized on the roadTravel is a big part of the job, and jet lag can be tough. My tip? Adjust to the local time zone right away, on the very same day you land! And no matter how long the flight, skipping a workout is not an option. I have a great team who selects the hotel according to the gym with proper equipments. That’s a a MUST. In case we don‘t find one, there is always a public gym nearby and I book a day pass.  SleepYou still should get enough sleep, this is the time when your body, your brain and your muscles recover. The strategy is to start dinner a bit earlier. And yes, I do stay out a bit longer with my team or with customers and partners — for a drink or good conversation. But I don’t do that every day during my trips. Important warning: Don‘t exercise when you feel sick. It can delay your recovery, can cause myocarditis, etc.. What's your strategy for staying energized during business travel?

Roland Busch,2025-07-01 13:42:43,Text,post,,3763,116,106,"+++Breaking News: Siemens completes the acquistion of Dotmatics +++ Exciting news today: We just completed the acquisition of Dotmatics. Here are 5 things about our latest acquisition that you should know: 🔬 1. Who is Dotmatics? Dotmatics is a leading provider of R&D software for the Life Sciences sector, based in the U.S. They support more than 2 million scientists around the world. Their portfolio combines advanced scientific applications with their Scientific Intelligence Platform, Luma – a unique, AI-enabled multimodal data platform trusted by top pharma and biotech companies.  💡 2. Why is this acquisition so important? Here's a striking fact: bringing just one new medicine to market typically takes over a decade and costs billions of dollars. One of the biggest challenges is that important research data is scattered across different systems - imagine trying to solve a puzzle when the pieces are spread across different rooms. 🤝 3. Why This Partnership is Revolutionary By joining forces, Siemens and Dotmatics are creating what we call a ""digital thread"" – a seamless connection from early laboratory research straight through to production. By combining Dotmatics’ scientific intelligence with our industrial AI technologies and digital twins we are creating a powerhouse that will accelerate medicine development and make treatments more affordable. 🚀 4. The Integration Plan Dotmatics will be integrated into our Digital Industries Software business. While we already serve the Life Sciences sector with our automation technology, software solutions and smart infrastructure for research facilities and production sites, this acquisition significantly expands our footprint in this dynamic market. We see great potential not only in Life Sciences but also in adjacent industries like chemicals, food & beverage, and materials. 💪 5. The Bigger Picture: ONE Tech Strategy This acquisition perfectly exemplifies our ONE Tech strategy in action. We're not just adding another company to our portfolio; we're creating a technological ecosystem that will transform how scientific research is conducted. The end goal? Stronger customer focus, faster innovations, and higher growth.  So, to sum things up: With Dotmatics, we’re building a new era of innovation in Life Sciences. From research through to production – we’re creating a unique, end-to-end digital thread. This will allow us to help our customers accelerate breakthroughs, reduce development cycles, and bring life-saving pharmaceuticals faster and more affordably to the market – to reach the people, who need them most.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7345809081133096962

Sein Tod macht uns traurig; er wird nicht nur der Telekom, sondern auch mir persönlich fehlen.

Besonders in Zeiten der Veränderung und des Fortschritts war er nicht nur Anwalt der Arbeitnehmenden, sondern immer auch Anwalt der Telekom und ihrer Zukunft insgesamt. Soziale Gerechtigkeit schloss bei ihm immer auch die kommende Generation ein. Seine konstruktive Herangehensweise an die Arbeit im Aufsichtsrat war vorbildlich.

Sozialpartnerschaft hatte für ihn einen hohen Stellenwert, und er pflegte selbst in Konfliktsituationen den Geist der Zusammenarbeit. Sozial und partnerschaftlich! Er hat Entscheidungen nicht nur moderierend herbeigeführt, sondern sie auch mitgetragen und aktiv vertreten. Besonders geschätzt habe ich seine Klugheit, mit der er mir immer ein guter persönlicher Ratgeber war.

Christian Klein,2025-06-27 15:40:46,Text + Photo,post,,1678,48,62,"One topic I often get asked about is the impact of hashtag#AI on productivity. While there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to that question, AI without doubt represents the greatest economic opportunity since the rise of the internet and is already a key driver of productivity across businesses in every industry. At SAP, we’re seeing the huge difference AI makes both for our customers and within our own business. But when it comes to adopting and getting the most out of AI, there are a number of critical success factors. One key aspect is regulation. Regulation is a must, but we also have to be careful not to overregulate at the expense of innovation. The focus should be on regulating the outcome, not the technology. Another reason companies struggle to realize the value of AI in their organizations is the data quality itself. High-quality data is the foundation for trusted AI, but companies often face the challenge of large data silos and how to bring together unstructured and structured data. In the age of AI, more than ever, having one common semantical data layer for your business data is key to understanding a business holistically, as well as the external trends that impact it.The third key piece is knowledge and change management. The value of AI is clear, but many companies are unsure about how they can best extract it and whether they have the skills they need to realize its potential for their business. Successfully applying AI is much more than simply implementing a piece of technology. The importance of upskilling, leadership, communication, and culture cannot be underestimated in any business transformation journey.In an increasingly unpredictable world, AI plays an important role in helping businesses thrive. Today, it's already driving agility, resilience, and productivity – and by focusing on the right regulatory frameworks, data quality, and change management, these benefits are set to increase even further.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7344389238211198976

Sometimes it’s a small vial—filled with a few teaspoons of blood—that carries the potential to change a life.Take multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that affects nearly 3 million people worldwide. For many, the wait for symptoms to appear, or for imaging to confirm what they already feel, can be full of uncertainty. Now a simple blood test can deliver key insights and help ensure patients get the right care at the right time. I find this quiet breakthrough so powerful.The test targets neurofilament light chain (NfL), a blood-based biomarker now detectable with a diagnostic test. This is the first CE-marked* biomarker for MS. When used together with other clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, NfL can help predict the risk of MS disease activity in an individual patient with RMS. These earlier insights help clinicians personalize treatment earlier and give the patient something often missing: clarity.It’s not dramatic on the outside, but the impact is very real.

I’m always astonished by how far we’ve come as a team, and excited by the pace at which we’re changing what will be possible tomorrow. So why not shine a light on some of the overlooked details—or, better yet, the quiet breakthroughs that make all the difference? Each background picture on my profile has its own story to tell. Yes, as a physicist and a Healthineer, I may be a bit biased. But I think many would agree: there’s a lot of art in science. And the details are often extraordinary.Take photon-counting CT, for example. To pioneer breakthroughs like this, we now grow crystals—cadmium telluride, to be exact—over 12 intense weeks. In nature, the same process would take millions of years. The purest cadmium telluride crystal is the starting point for a quantum leap in computed tomography technology. Years of research, development, and production have led to the creation of pure crystals with electrical properties that have revolutionized CT detector technology.Yes, it’s technical. But the impact is very human. Every touchpoint matters. Because these carefully grown crystals help deliver sharper insights, earlier answers, and better outcomes for everyone, everywhere, sustainably.This is just one glimpse behind the curtain.

What stood out to me was the broad agreement on some key points:1️⃣ Europe must remain attractive for industrial investment. That means speeding up permitting, simplifying regulation, and making funding tools work for real projects on the ground – not just in policy papers.2️⃣ We need to strengthen transatlantic ties without slipping into a tariff race. The conversation should be about industrial cooperation, not confrontation. Tariffs and retaliatory measures won’t make us more resilient – but coordinated action might.3️⃣ On China, the challenge is to rebalance, not to decouple. The goal must be to reduce risk without cutting ourselves off from vital trade and global innovation.4️⃣ Europe also needs a more strategic approach to how it supports its partners abroad. Finance aid should go hand in hand with industrial cooperation – especially in sectors like energy and infrastructure.5️⃣ And finally, we need to make Europe easier to build in. That means aligning rules with impact and simplifying regulation around hydrogen, grid procurement, and offshore wind.

Darum bin ich gerne der Einladung zum Kommunalkongress nachgekommen, um einen praktischen Impuls zu setzen: Wie können wir bei der Digitalisierung jetzt schneller vorankommen?Die Voraussetzung ist immer: Infrastruktur. Wir sind und bleiben – neudeutsch – comitted. Zwei von drei Glasfaseranschlüssen bauen wir. Rund 50 Milliarden Euro haben wir in den vergangenen zehn Jahren allein in Deutschland investiert. Und haben damit eine Infrastruktur geschaffen, die während Corona den Stresstest bestanden hat.Wir werden weiter bauen. Trotz Kosten, die zum Teil 8x so hoch sind wie in Spanien. 2,5 Millionen Haushalte pro Jahr. Noch ist die Nachfrage nach FTTH relativ gering. Aber sie wird steigen. Und wir werden darum auch immer mehr Wohnungen direkt anschließen.Die Telekom arbeitet kooperativ. Über 40 Partnerschaften haben wir beim Glasfaserausbau mit Stadtwerken geschlossen. Und wo für beide Seiten vertretbar mieten wir auch bestehende Infrastruktur an – so genannte Dark Fiber.Aber Digitalisierung ist nicht nur Infrastruktur. Sie ist auch, was wir auf den Netzen anbieten. Und die Digitalisierung ist gerade für die Kommunen ein großes Geschenk. Sie müssen bei knappen Kassen immer mehr Aufgaben bewältigen. Und auch der Frust mancher Bürger landet erst im örtlichen Rathaus, bevor er Berlin erreicht. Digitalisierung und KI werden helfen, Kommunen effizienter, aber auch nahbarer zu machen.Zu oft wird aber für digitale Lösungen das Rad immer wieder neu erfunden; anstatt auf bestehende und funktionierende Lösungen zurückzugreifen. „Der Hund bleibt der Hund. Ob in Kiel oder Konstanz“, habe ich dazu gesagt. Also brauche ich auch nicht verschiedene Software-Lösungen zum Thema Hundesteuer. Mein praktischer Vorschlag: Google, Amazon und Apple könne es schon lange, Microsoft mit Githup können es bei Business Software: Software für alle in einem App-Store bereitstellen. Und das gleiche machen wir jetzt für Verwaltubgssoftware.Der Bund stellt eine Cloud und den Rahmen bereit, alle Kommunen stellen ihre zertifizierte Software zur Verfügung und die Gemeinde, die digitalisieren will, sucht sich eine schon existierende Software.Die föderale Struktur bleibt erhalten. Wir bei der Deutschen Telekom würden uns freuen, wenn wir dabei helfen können. Denn digitale Verwaltung sind nicht nur schneller und günstiger, sondern vor allem bei Bürgern und Unternehmen akzeptierter.Oft sitzen Kommunen und Telekom vor Ort in einem Boot: Hohe Erwartungen treffen auf die Realität vor Ort. Mobilfunk ja, aber keinen Mast. Hier ist die Telekom auch auf Kommunen angewiesen, die bei der Standortsuche unterstützen oder Standorte zur Verfügung stellen.Mein Fazit: Im Netz ruckelt es Dank hoher Investitionen deutlich seltener. Im weiteren Ausbau aber schon. Es ist wichtig, dass wir weiter im Dialog bleiben, gute Lösungen finden und diese vor allem: Umsetzen.

Nach meinen drei Lieblingsprojekten wurde ich heute beim Panel-Talk mit Bundesumweltminister Carsten Schneider im Rahmen des BDEW Bundesverband der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V. Kongresses gefragt. Diese drei Innovationen sind ein wichtiger Beitrag zum Neustart der Energiewende:1. Digital Twins: Sie können Netzzustände in Echtzeit abbilden und somit mehr Transparenz über Netzanschlusskapazitäten zur Verfügung stellen. Verfügbare Netzkapazitäten können so unkompliziert online angefragt werden. Dies ermöglicht eine effizientere und schnellere Steuerung von Netzanschlussbegehren. 2. Einspeisesteckdose: In zwei Pilotprojekten in Bayern stellen wir proaktiv Netzkapazität zur Verfügung, zum Beispiel in Form eines neuen Trafos oder Umspannwerkes. Diese freie Kapazität schreiben wir dann in einem diskriminierungsfreien Verfahren aus und können die Ansiedelung von Erneuerbaren Energien und Speichern so teils netzgerecht steuern.3. Überbauung: Das ist ja ein bekanntes Konzept, das wir jetzt umsetzen. Hinter dem Netzanschlusspunkt vergeben wir mehr Kapazität als Folge einer sinnvollen Kombination aus Wind, PV und Speichern. Das Resultat: wir sparen Anschlussleistung ohne viel Energiemenge zu verlieren. Und wir nutzen bestehende Infrastruktur effizienter aus. Weitere innovative Konzepte wurden an unserem E.ON Stand vorgestellt, gemeinsam mit Bayernwerk MITNETZ STROM Westenergie E.ON One E.ON Deutschland und das E.ON Lab. Zum Beispiel haben die Kollegen dort den Bordsteinlader präsentiert, mit dem E-Autos ganz unkompliziert direkt am Bordstein geladen werden können. Doch all das reicht nicht aus, wenn die Rahmenbedingungen nicht mitziehen. Wir brauchen dringend politische Unterstützung.

But over time, I noticed something different.The people who made the biggest impact didn’t raise their voices—they listened, thought carefully, and spoke with intention. And when they did, people leaned in. Not because they were loud, but because they were clear, calm, and meaningful.We often mistake noise for confidence and silence or calmness for uncertainty. Some of the strongest voices on your team may be the quietest. Make space for them. Listen to them. Give them your trust and offer them psychological safety to speak up.The same goes for data. Especially in today’s VUCA world, it’s often the subtle, qualitative, so-called weak signals that can trigger meaningful trends – and not the noisy strong data. To spot the meaningful weak signals, we also need a culture of trust—where people feel psychologically safe to share insights, speak up, even when they argue with weak signals.

Diese Beharrlichkeit legen wir auch beim Thema hashtag#Nachhaltigkeit an den Tag. Seit Beginn haben wir den Anspruch, nachhaltig zu wirtschaften – und zwar aus Überzeugung, weil es auch wirtschaftlich sinnvoll ist. Unser Auftrag ist es, die Telekom als erfolgreiches, nachhaltiges Unternehmen zu führen, immer im Zusammenspiel von Ökonomie, Ökologie und Gesellschaft.  Daher verfolgen wir weiterhin unsere ehrgeizigen Klimaziele. Bis 2040 streben wir Netto-Null-Emissionen entlang unserer gesamten Wertschöpfungskette an. Ein großer Meilenstein zur grünen Telko ist bereits in Sicht: Wir sind auf Kurs zur hashtag#Klimaneutralität im eigenen Betrieb für 2025. Unser Erfolg beruht darauf, dass wir als globales Unternehmen Dinge bewerten und diskutieren, bevor wir sie umsetzen. Doch in der digitalen Welt wird es immer schwieriger, Sachverhalte zu beurteilen. Die zunehmende Verbreitung von Desinformation im Netz hat daran einen Anteil. Als Deutsche Telekom arbeiten wir mit vielen Partnern und gemeinnützigen Organisationen an der Stärkung eines kompetenten Umgangs mit digitalen Medien. So setzen wir uns schon im fünften Jahr im Rahmen unserer Initiative „Gegen Hass im Netz“ für bewussten Umgang und gegen Ausgrenzung oder Hate Speech ein.

Values must be clear, and consistently lived every day.

Have a positive attitude towards people, give them autonomy. But responsibility and accountability should go together, too. The most important words of leadership: Thank you! 🔹 Networked leadership: In today’s complex world, formal power isn’t enough. Listen to weak signals everywhere. Informal power by expertise or friendship must be considered as well. Get excellent people around you to leverage yourself in order to outperform.🔹 Confidence: Positive comes from positive 😉Thank you to Prof. Dr. Martin Hoegl, Matthias Mölleney, Yuval Kalish for your insights, and thanks to Raha Anssari, Katharina Piening and Sarah Wiegmann for organising the event.

For me personally, it has been an absolute privilege to experience more than half of that journey so far, seeing how our progress and pioneering role in CT exemplify what our company stands for. I joined the CT team as a product manager 26 years ago, right after we launched our newest innovation at the time: multislice CT technology with the SOMATOM Volume Zoom. Multislice took CT to another level, starting to transform the cross-sectional imaging (essentially, a 2D paradigm) into producing an ""isotropic 3D copy"" of the patient. A universe of new clinical applications opened up: from metastasis screening to vascular imaging to the first CT images of the coronaries. And viewing slices like on a film sheet, turned into browsing in the ""3D copy"" of the patient with the first post-processing applications. Making these breakthroughs available for everyone everywhere quickly became our target and within just one decade, all of our CT scanners, even in the entry level, had multislice technology inside. Among the things our CT team is exemplary for all Healthineers: the team constantly thinks ahead, never resting on their laurels. Even amid the ""Slice Wars"" in the early 2000s, they were already at work on the revolutionary dual-source CT technology while simultaneously starting the photon-counting project and becoming the frontrunner in AI applications. Their enduring mindset has driven incredible advances in cardiovascular imaging and in diagnosing cancer, stroke, and lung disease. CT has become so widely used across many cases that it’s now an essential tool in clinical settings like the emergency room and radiotherapy planning – the latter being elementary in our successful combination with Varian. As for photon-counting CT… We – and more importantly, many of our customers – are convinced it’s set to become the standard for CT in the future. It has the potential to be a true catalyst in preventive healthcare, helping to detect diseases earlier and creating an almost digital twin of the patient. With that level of insight, clinicians can make faster and more personalized decisions on the next step for their patient.We were the first to introduce the photon-counting CT scanner in 2021. Our focus has since shifted to a bigger question: how can we ensure everyone, everywhere truly benefits from this technology? Just as we were the fastest to make multislice CT accessible to all, our ambition now is to positively impact 1 billion lives over the next decade by bringing photon-counting CT within reach of more communities.We got to this point because of the dedication, vision, and hard work of hashtag#TeamHealthineers and – as importantly – through the inspiration, collaboration, trust, and scientific brilliance of our partners in clinical research in medical institutions worldwide.

Das lähmt Investitionen in Innovation und Transformation.- Bürokratie abbauen, nicht weiter aufbauen: Studien zeigen: Fünf bis 15 Prozent der Betriebskosten entstehen allein durch die bürokratischen Anforderungen, die an unsere Unternehmen gestellt werden. Das ist weder effizient noch zukunftsfähig.- Energiepolitik mit Weitblick: Es reicht nicht, Strompreise kurzfristig zu deckeln. Unternehmen brauchen Planungssicherheit. Die Energiewende muss kosteneffizienter ausgestaltet werden – durch einen intelligenten Ausbau von Wind- und Solarenergie unter Berücksichtigung der Netzdienlichkeit. Statt Ideologie brauchen wir Realitätssinn.Industrie und Politik tragen gemeinsam Verantwortung. Aber die nächsten Schritte liegen klar bei der Politik.Danke Björn Finke für das gute Gespräch!

Their commitment to enhancing – and saving – these young lives is truly inspiring, and we are honored that they have long been a Siemens Healthineers Global Pediatric Reference Center. CHMI is also an important scientific collaboration partner of ours, with cooperation going beyond the country to the CEECA regional level. Some recent collaboration projects include using brain scans to better understand how multiple sclerosis develops, testing different PET scans to find where seizures begin in children with epilepsy, and finding ways to make MRI scans less stressful for adolescents (and their parents). Thank you, Dr. Marek Migdał, Prof. Elżbieta Jurkiewicz, Prof. Bozenna Dembowska-Baginska, and Dr. Anna Śliwińska for your time and the great exchange between our teams!While collaboration with our scientific partners fuels innovation, it’s hands-on training and education for technicians and clinicians that bring that innovation to life in everyday healthcare. The experts at the 𝗦𝗶𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘀 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗔𝗰𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗺𝘆 in Warsaw play a key role in this effort, offering specialized master classes, many of them peer-to-peer, across all diagnostic modalities.

The plant will produce 450 metric tons of e-methanol per day – using green hydrogen and CO₂ captured from a waste incineration facility in Vaasa. Our technology delivers high carbon and hydrogen efficiency with minimal purge gas – significantly reducing the plant’s carbon intensity. A real step forward for hard-to-decarbonize sectors like maritime transport and e-fuels.

Some leaders do more than introducing new ideas—they lead with clarity, structure, and determination. Daniel Schulze Lammers, member of the Board of Management at HDI Group, is one such leader.His entrepreneurial mindset is rooted in real-world experience. Growing up on a farm, he learned early on that hard work pays off or that keeping an eye on costs is crucial.This is what I appreciate about Daniel: 🔹 Daniel faces challenges directly—rather than avoiding problems, he dives deep into them and actively works to solve them. 🔹 Daniel moves quickly and prioritizes progress—constantly seeking solutions. 🔹 Daniel balances strategy with execution—ensuring ideas translate into tangible results. 🔹 Daniel values a positive company culture—he fosters an environment characterised by clarity, structure, and accountability, thus laying the foundation for success.Daniel challenges the status quo, drives momentum, drives organizations forward and keeps a humble, people-first approach.

Viele von ihnen stehen am Anfang ihrer Karriere und wollen wissen, wie das bei mir damals war. Besonders häufig kommen diese drei Fragen. Vielleicht hilft es ja jemandem, wenn ich sie hier einmal gesammelt beantworte – ohne Anspruch auf Allgemeingültigkeit.🚀 ""Wie war der Start in dein Berufsleben?""Ich habe nach meiner Promotion in Theoretischer Physik bei Siemens angefangen. Aber es hat etwas gedauert, bis ich dort den richtigen Platz für mich gefunden hatte. Doch mit dem Verständnis für die Zusammenhänge von Medizin, Technik, Wirtschaft und Gesundheit wuchs dann auch die Begeisterung immer mehr. Ich weiß noch sehr genau, wie ich plötzlich morgens ohne Wecker aufgewacht bin, weil ich unbedingt wieder loslegen wollte, weil mich meine Aufgabe und die Menschen dort so fasziniert haben.🧠 ""Wer war – oder ist – dein Vorbild?""Ich glaube, dass man von jedem Menschen etwas lernen kann. Das ist das Schöne an diversen, internationalen Teams, wo jedes Mitglied einen anderen Hintergrund und andere Erfahrungen mitbringt. Besonders gerne erinnere ich mich aber an Professor Erich Reinhardt, damals Bereichsvorstand für die Medizintechnik bei Siemens. Er hat uns beigebracht, wie man richtig streitet. Das beste Argument zählt, nicht wer es vorbringt. ""Wir brauchen eine Streitkultur, keinen Harmonieterror"", hat er oft gesagt. Und damit hat er das Unternehmen, das ich jetzt führen darf, bis heute geprägt.🍽️ ""Hast du ein Rezept für beruflichen Erfolg?""Ich habe kein Rezept, aber vielleicht einen Rat. In der Rückschau sehe ich meinen Weg als eine Verkettung glücklicher Zufälle. Aber diese Zufälle müssen schon auf eine gute Vorbereitung treffen, damit sie auch wirken können. Ich glaube, für junge Menschen ist es wichtig, sich verschiedene Dinge anschauen zu können. So findet man heraus, was einen wirklich begeistert. Das Leben ist zu kurz, um Dinge zu tun, die man nicht liebt. Und dann wird man auch nicht gut darin. Lasst euch also nicht von anderen stressen, wenn ihr mit 18 oder 20 noch keinen großen Plan habt. Aber wartet auch nicht, bis euch auf magische Weise die Motivation überkommt. Fangt etwas an, schnuppert rein – wenn es das Richtige für euch ist, folgen Motivation und Erfolg dann ganz automatisch.Vor einiger Zeit hat Nina Bundels für die FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg mit mir dazu gesprochen.

Ich habe vor Kurzem ein ganz besonderes Interview geführt, das mir als Bergsteiger sehr gut gefallen hat: Zusammen mit der WirtschaftsWoche bin ich auf dem Baldeneysteig in Essen gewandert. Da gibt’s zwar keine Berge, aber Wald und sogar Steilhänge – und einen tollen Ausblick auf den Baldeneysee. Beim Wandern haben wir über die jetzt notwendigen Weichenstellungen in der Energie- und Wirtschaftspolitik gesprochen. Meine Botschaften: Deutschland muss die Kosten der Energiewende in den Griff kriegen. Dafür gibt es vier Hebel: Erstens, baut nicht nach einem Plan, der irgendwann mal festgelegt worden ist, sondern orientiert Euch an der echten Nachfrage. Die ändert sich nämlich. Zweitens, baut Erneuerbare nur in Abstimmung mit der Infrastruktur. Drittens, macht es marktorientiert. Und viertens, macht das ganze System flexibler und digitaler. Denn der Umbau der Energieversorgung gelingt nur, wenn die Menschen ihn akzeptieren und die Bürger als Kunden und Steuerzahler wissen, dass ihr Geld vernünftig ausgegeben wird.

The world is spinning faster every day – geopolitical change, economic uncertainty, tech disruption, demographic shifts – it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. I see lots of negative headlines and a resulting uncertainty in conversations with customers, partners, friends, and family. The truth is: We cannot afford to be paralysed by negativity and uncertainty. After all, economics is half psychology. Those who allow themselves to be paralysed cannot innovate, cannot inspire positive change. Confidence, on the other hand, is a source of energy. It drives us forward. It allows us to recognise and seize opportunities. I see so many things that make me confident about the future: 1️⃣ Our corporate and leadership culture based on trust is the cornerstone of our success.2️⃣ We are there for our customers when they need us the most, we enable innovation and transformation.3️⃣ Our engaged people are passionately making a difference for our customers, our company and society.Confidence really gets things done. 💪 So, let's not be driven by negative headlines. Instead, let's become the drivers of the change we wish to see in the world – with engagement and confidence.I was interviewed on this topic by Wolfgang Jenewein, professor at the University of St. Gallen, in his study ‘Confidence Index 2025’. Thank you very much, Wolfgang!

It is this combination that characterises exceptional leaders.2️⃣ Emotional leadership: Presence at important moments is crucial. Leaders are born in crunch time. That is why leaders need to be present with their teams.3️⃣ Star team vs. team of stars: A star team thrives on collaboration, where every member works towards common goals. The basis is a common vision and shared values. 4️⃣ Weak signals: Quotas and statistics do not show the whole picture. This is just as true in sport as it is in business. There are values that do not appear in any statistics. A good leader nevertheless recognises them. Svenja puts it in a nutshell: ""If you watch the game you can see it.""5️⃣ Leadership in uncertainty: In a fast-moving world, adaptability, curiosity and an understanding of situations are essential for success.A team in sport and in business is only as strong as the people who make it up.

They help me slow down, think differently, or simply step out of the day-to-day.Books generally serve so many purposes – they educate, advise, cheer you up, distract, enlighten. Sometimes they do all of that at once. And since today is hashtag#WorldBookDay, I thought I’d share a few titles from my shelf. Not as a top three list, but just as a few books that have meant something to me and can perhaps mean something to you too.📘 To change behavior: Matthew Walker – Why We SleepThis book is a wake-up call by making a strong case for taking sleep seriously. Not just as a health topic but as something deeply tied to how we work, make decisions, and live our lives. In a world that never seems to stop, it’s a helpful reminder that rest isn’t a luxury – it’s essential.📙 To escape a little: Haruki Murakami – The City and Its Uncertain WallsMurakami’s books create their own universe – one where time moves differently. This one is no exception. It’s a quiet, dreamlike space to step into when I need to disconnect. His storytelling is often abstract, but that’s part of what makes it such a good distraction from the pace of everyday life.📓 To shift perspective: JR – Can Art Change the World?Pictures can say more than a thousand words, and JR’s work – enormous portraits of everyday people pasted onto city walls, rooftops, even shipping containers – does exactly that. This book captures how he uses art to give people visibility, to tell stories that otherwise wouldn’t be heard. It’s not loud but still incredibly powerful.

Bernd Montag,2025-04-17 06:20:18,Carousel,post,post,260,10,1,"With Easter and perhaps a spring vacation just around the corner, you may be looking for some food for thought. I'd like to recommend three eye-opening hashtag#books that explore human nature with a sense of hashtag#hope – both through hashtag#science and personal narrative.📖 ""The Righteous Mind"" (2012) by Jonathan Haidt:I greatly admire Jonathan Haidt's work and recently had the privilege of meeting him at the WEF 2025. Jonathan is a social psychologist at the NYU Stern School of Business. ""The Righteous Mind"" is not his most recent book, but a bestseller that offers explanations for many questions driving society and politics today. How does social polarization develop? Why do we have such different moral perceptions of justice, freedom, and authority? Why are we individuals on the one hand and enjoy being part of groups on the other? And what is this built-in ""PR agency"" that justifies our actions to others?📖 ""Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society"" (2019) by Nicholas A. Christakis:Another bestseller, another deep dive into our DNA, minds and societies: Nicholas Christakis is a social scientist and physician at Yale University whose work focuses on network science and biosocial science. His book ""Blueprint"" really resonated with me, in showing that our ability to build fair, cooperative communities is hardwired into our DNA—it's human nature, not just ideology. It helped me see why many utopian visions fail: they overlook the social structures we're biologically built to form. The book highlights the common ground we all share. In times of division, I found ""Blueprint"" to be a refreshing take on the idea that the drive to build inclusive, connected communities isn’t political—it's human.📖 ""Vaterländer"" (2024) by Sabin Tambrea:Sabin Tambrea is a German actor with Romanian roots. His German novel ""Vaterländer"" draws from real events and his family’s personal experiences. It's an incredibly sensitive and moving book, in which the author tells how the communist dictatorship in Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu oppressed three generations of his family and caused them immense suffering—leading to their escape and a fresh start in Germany. It made me reflect on utopias, on why dictatorships can persist for so long—and it offers a lot of hope through its humanity.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318518653925122048

The (physical) leap is small, but our T-Labs have taken a big step towards the Internet of the future. The quantum internet.Data is no longer transmitted using light waves, but with the help of quantum particles (so-called photon qubits). In a nutshell, this enables extremely fast data transmission and a high level of security. Because as soon as someone tries to intercept data, the state of the quantum particles is disturbed. This is noticed immediately. However, the current challenge is to keep the quantum particles stable in the network. So far, only data transmissions over short distances have been successful in the laboratory.Together with the company Qunnect, T-Labs has now implemented a quantum connection under real conditions in a Telekom fiber optic network. The connection remained stable over two weeks and 30 kilometers. Parallel to “classic transmission” via light waves. Both technologies are therefore conceivable side by side in the network in the future. Telekom's fiber optic network is: Quantum ready.The next step will be to launch pilot projects based on the trial. Possible areas of application: High-precision sensor technology in the Internet of Things, time synchronization in satellite networks - and, of course, highly secure communication for companies and public authorities.Congratulations to T-Labs, Claudia Nemat, Qunnect and the teams who worked on it.

Also kommen wir zum zweiten Buch für heute. Aktuell versuchen Regierungen rund um den Globus ja eher, sich gegenseitig das Wasser abzugraben. Da ist es im Kontrast sehr faszinierend, wie die Römer schon vor 2000 Jahren eine sensationelle Wasserversorgung aufgebaut haben. Sie waren echte „Playmaker“, wie Klaus Grewe in seinem Buch zeigt. Und genau das ist es übrigens, was uns auch bei E.ON reizt. Denn wir haben zwar nichts mit Wasser zu tun, aber treiben die Transformation des Energiesystems voran. Jede Zeit hat ihre Herausforderungen – und ihre Playmaker. Apropos Herausforderungen: Weder bei uns noch bei den alten Römern ist alles leicht. Das Buch von Julius Sextus Frontinus ist zwar eher etwas für Spezialisten. Ich habe mich trotzdem köstlich amüsiert, wie Sextus Frontinus bei der Wasserversorgung von Rom mit den Problemen gekämpft hat, die wir auch heute haben. Wie kann man Instandhaltung von Infrastruktur möglichst günstig sicherstellen? Welche gesetzliche Basis haben wir auf privates Land zu kommen? Wie funktioniert eine Konzession? Wie verhindert man Bepflanzung rechts und links von Leitungskorridoren? Wie verhindert man ungerechtfertigte Entnahmen aus dem Leitungssystem?

Denn Deutschland braucht in dieser Lage dringend eine handlungsfähige Regierung. Und genau daran, am konkreten Regierungshandeln, messen wir die künftige Bundesregierung. Deutschland muss jetzt daran arbeiten, wieder stärker zu werden. Und das gelingt nur mit mutigen Reformen. Wir setzen darauf, dass die Bundesregierung dazu die Kraft und Entschlossenheit findet. Bezogen auf die Energiepolitik heißt das: Die Energiewende so effizient zu gestalten wie möglich, um die Systemkosten im Griff zu behalten. Im Koalitionsvertrag stehen hierzu viele richtige energiepolitische Maßnahmen. Alle werden aber gleichzeitig kaum finanzierbar sein. Die Herausforderung liegt darin, jetzt die richtigen Prioritäten zu setzen. E.ON wird auch der neuen Bundesregierung als Dialogpartner für diese Einordnung zur Verfügung stehen. Es gibt hierzu eine ganze Reihe von geeigneten Anknüpfungspunkten in dem Papier: Wir brauchen einen anpassungsfähigen Pfad für den Ausbau von Erneuerbaren und der Energieinfrastruktur, der es erlaubt, auf den Stromverbrauch in Zukunft flexibel zu reagieren. Deshalb begrüßen wir die angekündigte Analyse des tatsächlichen Bedarfs und das geplante Monitoring. Auch die ausdrückliche Stärkung der Stromnetze als Rückgrat der Energiewende als Koalitionsziel ist zu begrüßen. Der Weg zur Klimaneutralität muss insgesamt marktrationaler gestaltet und Ausbau und Einspeisung von Erneuerbaren und Speichern systemdienlicher ausgerichtet werden. Auch hier finden sich wichtige Punkte, etwa die regionale Steuerung des Zubaus oder das grundsätzliche, energiepolitische Ziel, dass Erneuerbare sich perspektivisch selbst am Markt finanzieren müssen. Eng damit verbunden ist die angekündigte Überprüfung des Anreiz- und Förderregimes auch für Bestandsanlagen. Schließlich muss in der nächsten Legislaturperiode die Flexibilisierung und die Digitalisierung der Energieversorgung entschlossen vorangetrieben werden. Beiträge zur Senkung des Strompreisniveaus sowohl für Wirtschaft wie Endverbraucher sind prinzipiell ebenfalls zu begrüßen. Allerdings dürfen Strompreissubventionen und staatliche Förderungen im Energiesektor nicht zu einem Dauerzustand werden, weil damit direkte staatliche Investitionen in Innovation, Wachstum und Wehrfähigkeit eingeschränkt werden. Stattdessen müssen wir an die eigentlichen Ursachen heran. Hierzu gehört insbesondere, einen starken Fokus auf Elektrifizierung zu setzen, wo immer möglich.

Diese enormen Kosten, die allein in einem Monat angefallen sind, entsprechen etwa dem gesamten Jahresetat einer mittelgroßen deutschen Stadt. Und die Redispatch-Kosten übers ganze Jahr mit knapp 3 Mrd. Euro sind zwar etwas niedriger als in den Vorjahren aber immer noch eine komplette Geldverschwendung als Ergebnis fehlender Netzinfrastruktur bzw. eines Erneuerbaren-Ausbaus ohne Rücksicht auf die Netze. Nochmal kurz zur Erklärung: Redispatch-Kosten entstehen durch den notwendigen Eingriff in die Stromerzeugung zur Vermeidung von Netzengpässen, genannt Abregelung, auf der einen Seite des Engpasses und dem Gegenteil, also dem Hochfahren von Erzeugung hinter dem Engpass. Allgemein ist es erfreulich, dass die Abregelmengen niedriger geworden sind, auch in Folge des Netzausbaus. Aber Extremsituationen, wie die Windfront an vielen Offshore-Windkraftanlagen im Dezember 2024, führen weiterhin zu sehr hohen Redispatch-Kosten.

Ein deutscher Standard, der zeigt, was im Innern Europas schlummert: Mut zur Schaffung sinnvoller Standards, die unser Leben verbessern.Was mich besonders fasziniert, ist die Kombination aus mathematischer Eleganz und praktischer Anwendung. Das Verhältnis 1:√2 zwischen Länge und Breite ist pure Genialität. Es stellt sicher, dass beim Halbieren des Blattes das Seitenverhältnis erhalten bleibt – eine Eigenschaft, die sich durch alle Formate der A-, B- und C-Reihe zieht.Interessant ist auch, dass die Einführung keineswegs reibungslos verlief. Kritiker sprachen von ""Zwang"" und ""Entpersönlichung"" durch die Norm. Doch die Realität zeigte: Die Standardisierung vereinfachte Produktion und Lagerung, sparte Ressourcen und ermöglichte effizienteres Arbeiten – vom Briefumschlag bis zum Aktenschrank.Für mich ist das DIN-A-Format ein Musterbeispiel kluger Standardisierung. Es löst mehrere praktische Probleme gleichzeitig, schafft messbaren Mehrwert für alle Beteiligten und beschränkt sich auf das Wesentliche.Und während wir uns heute in Überregulierung verlieren, beweist es seit über 100 Jahren: Die beste Regulierung ist die, die so einfach wie möglich und nur so komplex wie nötig ist.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7314890675211173888

Industrial AI is not an add-on. To maximize impact, Industrial AI and data-driven technologies should not just be added to existing processes. Instead, they must be deeply integrated in software, hardware, and along the industrial value chain. Btw: On the subject of AI, I had a great time trying out our own AI Agents by producing a ""Robostar"" 😉 And we were thrilled to receive the Hermes Award for our Siemens Industrial Copilot! 👏 2. Technology-based ecosystems are the great accelerator. To innovate at the speed we need, we have to work together, in open, trusted partnerships. Glad I got to visit so many customers & partners, be it Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud or Microsoft. And I was excited to announce the expansion of our partnership with Accenture, which will make it easier for our customers to accelerate their digital transformation.  3. It’s time for a new operating system. The operating system of the world, the system we had become accustomed to, it is becoming obsolete. And perhaps no other economy is impacted more than Germany. Germany needs less bureaucracy to enable more, faster innovations.

Roland Busch,2025-04-03 14:02:50,Text + Photo,post,post,1516,83,64,"Are we the last generation of leaders who are managing companies with humans only? That’s a question a colleague asked me over dinner recently.  “The next generation will manage a team of humans and AI agents,” he said. And while it’s only a thought experiment today, I think we would be wise to prepare for a blended workforce of the future.  A few thoughts on how:  1. Establish a growth mindset now. This is not just about improving our AI fluency (though that’s important!) but also demonstrating adaptability to new ways of working. It’s about creating a culture where our human colleagues are open to collaboration with intelligent machines to unlock the opportunities for value creation. Where they are open to changing their ways of working and view AI agents as partners, not threats.  2. Set standards for trust. If your AI agents give you different answers each time you ask a question, I wouldn’t recommend you let them control your machines 😉 It’s important to understand how your agents are trained and how they perform in high-stakes situations. That’s why Siemens is now developing an Industrial Foundation Model. Equally important: Establish systems to continually measure their performance, just as you do with your people.  3. Unleash creativity.  It’s about ensuring that humans focus on what humans are uniquely qualified to do, while agents focus on areas where AI has the upper hand. As technology evolves, this is something we will continually experiment with, ensuring we create meaningful, sustainable jobs and make the most of a blended workforce.  How are you making decisions about what to entrust to AI? And how will you ensure that you and your human colleagues are equipped to collaborate with their agentic counterparts? I’d love to hear. Also, thanks to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung for picking it up as “quote of the week” 😉",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7313561624840212480

The forum’s theme, “Unleashing Development Momentum for Stable Growth of Global hashtag#Economy,” highlights the urgent need for deeper cooperation in an increasingly complex global environment. I had the chance to share my views during the session “Cooperation in the Development of Global Industrial and Supply Chains” and in conversations with leading Chinese media. One message emerged clearly: Global hashtag#supplychains are under pressure – but transformation also brings opportunity. This is the moment to embrace innovation and strengthen collaboration.  To stay competitive and resilient, we need to:✔ Strengthen international hashtag#collaboration to foster a mutually beneficial supply chain system.✔ Increase supply chain hashtag#resilience and flexibility to balance cost, security, and efficiency.✔ Seize global green development opportunities and build more hashtag#sustainable supply chains. Amid growing pressure from climate change and the global push for hashtag#decarbonization, low-carbon supply chains have become a strategic imperative. At thyssenkrupp, we are addressing this through solutions like more climate-friendly hashtag#steel from thyssenkrupp Steel, intelligent supply chain technologies from thyssenkrupp Materials Services, and cutting-edge innovations from hashtag#thyssenkrupp Decarbon Technologies driving the hashtag#greentransformation.

Denn sie ist der kostengünstigste Weg, CO2-Emmissionen zu reduzieren. Auch bei der Netzinfrastruktur lassen sich durch bessere regionale Steuerung des EE-Zubaus und Freileitungen statt Erdkabel erhebliche Kosten sparen.

Before we hit the show floor tomorrow, I wanted to recap a few key messages from my opening speech: 1) The world is transforming massively right now and at record speed. The operating system of the world is outdated, and perhaps no other economy is impacted more than Germany. It is time for a new operating system. A new operating system that functions with less bureaucracy and that not only allows but supports more and faster innovation.  2) Building this new operating system will be hard work. Businesses AND governments have to work together and in synch. This is a job for all of us. I recently shared a 10 points program for Germany, which I see as important for the political agenda in the coming years. See the link in the comments for details. 3) Companies need to rebuild, with AI and data at the core. With technology evolving at a rapid clip, there’s a temptation to just add AI it onto whatever you’re already doing. But it doesn’t work that way. AI is not an accessory. Instead, it must be central to the infrastructure of our products and processes — and our companies as a whole.  Looking forward to connecting with many of you these next few days at Hannover Messe.

Thanks so much for sharing our excitement. However, some of you have also asked what this now means concretely? Fair enough 😉 We got you covered: Let’s have a look at a practical example:My colleague Carlos from Siemens in Krefeld is already using Altair’s software. With this software they can for example, ensure that all the train’s components have the required stability. You know what it’s like when a train enters a tunnel or passes another train. You feel a pressure wave. The train has to withstand this force, day after day, for over 30 years. Millions of times. With the simulation, they can determine how stable the car body has to be without using excess materials.So, with Altair technology, Siemens can now create the world's most complete portfolio for AI-powered design, engineering and simulation. This is a boost to our strategy to combine the real and the digital worlds. Because we add mechanical and electromagnetic simulation to our industrial software.

As we step up to lead, and I'm confident we will, three imperatives stand before us. At yesterday's Hashtag#EUROPE2025 conference, I outlined what these imperatives are:First, Europe must lead the clean-tech revolution. To get there, we need a culture that embraces failure. And ""Failing big time"" must be allowed – in fact, it's essential. Without the courage to fail, we won't achieve the breakthrough innovations our transformation demands.Second, we need a competitive framework that works. Stop micromanaging our industries and start enabling innovation. We need efficient energy systems, market-based solutions, and competitive electricity costs for energy-intensive sectors. The alternative is deindustrialization, and we cannot let that happen.Third, we must focus on what we, as businesses, can control. While external challenges persist, our focus must be our internal transformation. Digitalization and AI aren't buzzwords – they're tools to revolutionize R&D, production, and customer engagement. Our people, empowered by the right corporate culture, will drive this change.The path forward is clear.

Leo Birnbaum,2025-03-27 08:39:08,Text + Video,post,post,206,6,2,"Electrification is the key to an affordable energy transition. Because electrons are the most cost efficient energy carriers. But electrification will not proceed with the necessary speed if there are no tangible benefits for consumers. Consumers would of course profit in general from lowering the transition costs by around €1.5 trillion by 2050 and dropping the system costs when electrification picks up speed as I highlighted here some days ago. But they would as well directly benefit from electrification in their households.Due to higher efficiencies compared to fuel-based vehicles and gas boilers, the usage of electric vehicles and power driven heat pumps substantially reduces total energy bill of a household. In the face of increases in carbon prices over the next years and declines in electricity costs per kilowatt-hour, the price advantage of electrified assets over fossil-based technologies will further increase – despite higher upfront investments for now. At the same time, electrification can empower consumers with greater control over their total energy consumption and expenses. Moreover, with potential self-produced solar PV electricity, designated heat pump tariffs, and demand side flexibility, there is significant upside cost saving potential for electrified households. When combined with digital metering systems, end users gain visibility, and to some extent, direct control over their energy consumption and costs.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7310943446465236992

Unser Problem war nicht, dass wir zu wenig Geld hatten, sondern dass wir unsere Spielräume nicht für Investitionen genutzt haben. Die Graphik (Quelle: Die Zeit) ist ein Indikator, was wir stattdessen gemacht haben. Leider schaffen Sozialleistungen keinen nachhaltigen Wohlstand. Nachhaltiger Wohlstand entsteht durch höhere Produktivität, Innovation und Wachstum.  Was ist zu tun? Die finanziellen Freiräume aus den massiven Schuldenpaketen müssen investiert werden; in Sicherheit, Wachstum und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Sie müssen zusätzlich (!) zu den Investitionen sein, die jetzt schon im Haushalt stehen.  Was ist NICHT zu tun? Mit öffentlichem Geld private Investitionen verdrängen. Die Freiräume nutzen, um Reformen zu vermeiden. Den Staat noch weiter aufblähen (unser Problem ist auch nicht, dass wir zu wenige Angestellte im öffentlichen Dienst haben). Deutschland kann sich diesen einmaligen Boost erlauben. Nachhaltig aber wird er erst mit einem Wachstum über 2%. Da liegt Friedrich Merz völlig richtig. Und wenn wir den Boost nicht nutzen, um stärker zu werden, um zu reformieren, dann haben wir am Ende nur mehr Schulden für unsere Kinder produziert. Ich hoffe die Verhandlungspartner in Berlin werden auch dieser Verantwortung, eine mutige Reform- und Wachstumsagenda aufzustellen, gerecht.

Das haben Markus Krebber und ich gestern in einem gemeinsamen Interview in der Frankfurter Allgemeinen Sonntagszeitung deutlich gemacht. In den aktuell laufenden Koalitionsverhandlungen werden die Weichen für die Zukunft der Energiewende gestellt. RWE und E.ON haben gemeinsam ein energiepolitisches Programm entwickelt, das aus der Perspektive des Gesamtsystems die wichtigsten Veränderungen beschreibt, die die neue Bundesregierung schnell und mutig vornehmen sollte, um die Kosten der Energiewende spürbar zu senken. Denn nur, wenn wir die Systemkosten in den Griff bekommen, erfährt die Energiewende die notwendige Akzeptanz der Menschen in unserem Land. Folgende Punkte stehen für uns dabei im Mittelpunkt:➡️ Die Planung des Ausbaus sollte sich am echten Bedarf orientieren und nicht auf politischen Zielmarken basieren, die vor Jahren beschlossen wurden. Wir brauchen realistische Szenarien, z.B. in Bezug auf die unterstellte Stromnachfrage. ➡️ Der Europäische Emissionshandel (EU-ETS) ist das Steuerungsinstrument zur Dekarbonisierung. ➡️ Die einheitliche deutsche Strompreiszone muss erhalten bleiben. Eine Aufspaltung würde die Liquidität in Markt erheblich beinträchtigen.➡️ Wir brauchen einen technologieoffenen, zentralen Kapazitätsmarkt bis 2028, der den Zubau von Gaskraftwerken unter Berücksichtigung von Netzkapazitäten anreizt. Und es macht auch keinen Sinn, diese nach acht Jahren unbedingt auf H2 umzustellen. ➡️ Die Erneuerbaren sind reif für den Markt und sollten in ihn entlassen werden. Der weitere Rollout kann durch Investitionsförderung angereizt werden. Einige Technologien brauchen gar keine Förderung mehr. Erneuerbaren- und Netzausbau müssen effizienter verschränkt werden und bei der Standortwahl muss die Auslastungssituation der Netze vor Ort berücksichtigt werden. ➡️ Flexibilität muss belohnt werden. Ein modernes Energiesystem muss Angebot und Nachfrage dynamisch ausgleichen. Der flächendeckende Rollout eines simplen und kostengünstigen Smart Meters ist dafür Voraussetzung. ➡️ Die europäische Definition für grünen Wasserstoff ist zu eng und muss deutlich vereinfacht werden. Zudem braucht es einen pragmatischeren Ansatz für den Hochlauf von CCS.Der Klimawandel wartet nicht und die Energiewende muss ein Erfolg werden – deshalb brauchen wir jetzt den Neustart. So wie wir Reformen überall brauchen, um wieder wettbewerbsfähig zu werden und zu wachsen.

Die Reform der Schuldenbremse und ein neues Sondervermögen sollen den Weg freimachen für dringend benötigte Investitionen – für Sicherheit, Infrastruktur und nachhaltiges Wachstum. Das sorgte weltweit für Aufmerksamkeit: bei Regierungen, Unternehmen und an den Finanzmärkten.Zehn Tage später liegt die Einigung von Union, SPD und Grünen auf dem Tisch. Sie bringt Klarheit, sie macht Mut. Es bleibt allerdings die Erkenntnis, dass dies nicht reichen wird, um die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit Deutschlands zu stärken!Die versprochene Zusätzlichkeit entpuppt sich als Formelkompromiss. Im Kleingedruckten steht: Die Investitionsquote muss nur noch bei zehn Prozent des Bundeshaushalts liegen – das liegt sehr deutlich unter dem Anteil an Investitionen in den letzten Jahren. Das nimmt den Druck, Investitionen aus dem laufenden Haushalt zu tätigen – und lädt dazu ein, stattdessen mit dem Geld Haushaltslöcher zu stopfen oder neue konsumtive Ausgaben zu beschließen. Beides darf nicht passieren, unter anderem auch um die gerade zurückgewonnene Glaubwürdigkeit nicht zu beschädigen. Was als Fortschritt verkauft wird, kann so am Ende doch zum Verschiebebahnhof werden. Die neue Koalition muss sich eine ""Vorfahrt für Wachstum""-Regel geben: Die Investitionsquote muss mindestens stabil gehalten werden. Zusätzliche konsumtive Ausgaben dürfen nur durch zusätzliches Wachstum finanziert werden. So können Investitionen in die Zukunft die höhere Schuldenlast wieder tilgen.Die schnelle Einigung macht aber auch Mut zu mehr. Denn Deutschland braucht dringend ein neues Betriebssystem, um zukunftsfähig zu werden. Dafür habe ich einen 10-Punkte-Plan vorgeschlagen. Ambitionslosigkeit ist kein guter Ratgeber in den laufenden Verhandlungen. Das gilt besonders bei Bürokratieabbau und Strukturreformen – von wettbewerbsfähigen Energiepreisen über Rahmenbedingungen für Startups und Innovationen bis zur Gewinnung von Fachkräften und Beschleunigung von Baumaßnahmen. Lösungsvorschläge liegen auf dem Tisch. Jetzt braucht es Mut zur schnellen und konsequenten Umsetzung. Die kommende Regierung kann jetzt noch die richtigen Weichen stellen. Ich bin sicher: Schnelle Reformen, nachhaltige Investitionen, glaubwürdige Führung – das ist der Weg zurück an die Weltspitze.

(BBUG), preparing for increasingly responsible roles alongside amazing peers from companies across various industries. Today, after more than 10 years as CEO of Siemens Healthineers, I had the honor and pleasure of speaking to those who are now preparing for their own future leadership roles, having been nominated by their companies.I always greatly enjoy moments like these—they are enriching, offering fresh perspectives and thought-provoking questions. Plus, simply explaining one’s own work helps sharpen one’s own thinking.Of course, there was a lot to share at the beginning: about non-communicable diseases (cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, etc.), which we are dedicated to combating; about access to care for 8 billion people; and about the shortage of healthcare professionals among our customers. We also discussed our IPO, the combination with Varian, the central role of AI in our products, the path to groundbreaking innovations like Photon-Counting CT, and our Value Partnerships with leading customers.The discussion that followed was lively and engaging, conducted under Chatham House Rules—which is why I summarize the following seven key takeaways:1️⃣ We should not see healthcare spending as a cost but as an investment in a better life.2️⃣ The healthcare industry is a vital yet often underestimated part of a country's economic value creation.3️⃣ Medical technology is an exciting ""dialogue discipline"" where progress is only possible through deep mutual understanding between medical professionals and engineers. This is fascinating—but also teaches humility.4️⃣ Our IPO allowed us to create a much more focused company, entirely dedicated to our specific customer base, and to reinvent ourselves. I am deeply grateful for that. And only through the IPO the combination with Varian was possible, for example.5️⃣ Progress always moves in two directions: Improving what already exists and creating access where it was previously unaffordable.For example, digitalization initially digitizes what was analog, but ""digital first"" solutions bypass analog altogether, making things possible for the first time. Many medical breakthroughs follow the same principle.6️⃣ Right now, we talk a lot about managing change in the world. My advice: from time to time, consciously reflect on what does NOT change and what always holds true.7️⃣ And lastly: Take good care of your own health and your relationships.Thank you, Baden-Badener Unternehmer Gespräche e.V.

Simplicity doesn’t mean being careless or shallow; it’s about focusing on what truly matters. It’s about sharpening focus, improving execution, and delivering real results.

The equipment produced there will support critical sectors such as the commercial, industrial and construction markets while powering AI data centers all over the country. With that Siemens is more than doubling its production capacity of electric equipment to power critical American infrastructure.  The U.S. is already the largest market for Siemens. This is why Siemens has invested over $90 billion in the country in the last 20 years. This year’s investment will boost this number to over $100 billion with the planned acquisition of Altair Engineering. So, we are bringing more jobs, more technology and a boost to America’s AI capabilities.  All of this would not have been possible without the amazing people who work for us - thank you, hashtag#TeamSiemens!",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7303485833355878400

The annual investments for the European energy transition need to more than double by 2030 to 6.6 trillion Euro. At the same time investments in the rearmament of the continent are urgently needed and will require another enormous amount of capital. In this context, it is essential that we drive the energy transition in Europe as efficiently as possible. Yesterday, we launched our Energy Playbook, a model study which shall help EU decision makers to save investments in the energy transition without giving up our climate targets.The study shows:  Europe can become climate-neutral by 2050 whilst at the same time making significant cost savings of up to 1.5 trillion Euros.   To get there Europe should➡️ prioritize decarbonization strategies and start earlier with cheaper strategies in terms of CO2 reduction costs.➡️ focus on Electrification as the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions.➡️ synchronise the expansion of grids and renewables to reduce avoidable costs.➡️  foster digitalization and flexibilization of new energy to save customers’ money.➡️ drive integration of Energy Union to make the energy system more efficient. Europe can be more than the sum of its parts. To put it together – it’s on Europe!

I often observe that in uncertain times leaders tend to revert to a ‘command and control’ leadership style. But, for most of you control isn’t the solution to address the challenges of a VUCA world. How we create trust is the solution. You also gave some great insights on how a true leader earns trust:🔹 Leading by example—actions over authority and control.🔹 Being transparent, honest, and fair.🔹 Listening, learning, and empowering people to grow.🔹 Fostering innovation by letting go of control.🔹 Taking ownership, especially in challenging times.🔹 Staying human—admitting and learning from mistakes.🔹 Putting people first and believing in their potential.Thanks to Jasmin Glehn, Sonia Quickfall, Denise Barreto, Jan Myszkowski, Selçuk Altuner, Judith McCartney, MaLM, Jonathan Romley 🇺🇦, Mauricio Giuntini for sharing your insights.At Talanx Group culture is strategy.

The Mobile World Congress (MWC) is far more than a mobile communications exhibition – it is the ""showcase of the digital economy,"" as the press aptly describes it. Under the motto ""Shaping Technology for All,"" we at Deutsche Telekom focused on AI technologies this year. We are particularly proud of our AI Phone, which attracted a lot of attention with Perplexity's digital assistant. Other exhibits at our stand included a drone as a flying mobile antenna, successfully used at the ""Jizerská 50"" ski race in the Czech Republic to provide coverage in hard-to-reach areas, and our AI honeypots, which mislead hackers and help us better understand their tactics. Of course, a visit to the 4YFN area – the meeting place for start-ups whose solutions could be ubiquitous in four years – was a must. There, we also visited our second stand with start-ups from hubraum. I was particularly impressed by the startup Matterway, which automates decision-making processes and is already in use at our DTSE. In the investor area, four start-ups pitched exclusively for us. Particularly exciting for me was terralayr, energy storage as a service. This is a solution that could help us at Telekom to manage our energy consumption more intelligently. The hashtag#MWC was once again a great opportunity to exchange ideas with colleagues, partners, and innovative minds. The largest telco fair is like a class reunion.

Through strategic partnerships, such as our collaboration with the TITAN Group, pioneering projects like hashtag#greenhydrogen and hashtag#methanol, and the decarbonization of industrial plants, we are establishing Decarbonization Technologies as a key player in the market. We are proving that hashtag#decarbonization is not just a vision but a business model with real impact. At the same time, the market is evolving more slowly than expected. Customers hesitate, projects are delayed, and uncertainty affects decision-making. But standing still is not an option.

In light of ongoing Hashtag#digitalization, bold political changes are essential to promote investment, innovation, and competitiveness. I discussed this at Hashtag#MWC with Christel Heydemann from Orange, Margherita Della Valle from Vodafone, and Marc Murtra Millar from Telefonica, moderated by Shaun Collins.1️. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗰𝘆: The telecom industry is capital-intensive. Markets with fewer providers see higher per capita investments, enabling better networks and services. EU merger regulations focus too much on short-term price effects rather than long-term benefits like Hashtag#innovation. These regulations need updating.2️. 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗕𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘂𝗰𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆: Telecom regulations are stuck in the past. We still regulate fiber optic networks like old copper infrastructures despite intense competition. In Germany, over 250 fiber providers are building networks. It's necessary to move away from cumbersome rules to foster innovation.3️. 𝗙𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗰𝘆: Every euro spent on frequency fees is a euro not invested in infrastructure. Longer frequency licenses and more available frequencies, especially in the upper 6 GHz band, are crucial for developing 5G and future 6G networks.4️. 𝗦𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗧𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺: The telecom market in the EU is highly fragmented. National restrictions lead to inefficiencies. The telecommunications framework needs harmonization to avoid a patchwork of different regulations.5️. 5𝗚 𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: New services must be developed. Technologies like Hashtag#5G slicing could transform the industry, but regulatory uncertainties hinder progress. We need clear guidance from the EU Commission.6️. 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺: Consumers view telecom services and OTT platforms like WhatsApp equally, so they should be similarly regulated. Mobile data traffic will triple by 2030. Fair commercial prices for data transport services are necessary, and regulation should intervene in unfair conditions.7️. 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗻𝘁𝘆: Europe depends on third countries for over 80% of its digital infrastructure. Investments in its own cloud and AI capacities are essential to address strategic weaknesses.Time to act: Europe's telecom industry is crucial for digital transformation.

Darüber habe ich auf dem Hashtag#MWC mit Christel Heydemann von Orange, Margherita Della Valle von Vodafone und Marc Murtra Millar von Telefonica gesprochen, moderiert von Shaun Collins. 1️. 𝗪𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗯𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗯𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗸: Die Telko-Branche ist kapitalintensiv. Märkte mit weniger Anbietern verzeichnen höhere Investitionen pro Kopf, was bessere Netze und Dienste ermöglicht. Die EU-Fusionsvorschriften konzentrieren sich zu sehr auf kurzfristige Preiseffekte und nicht auf langfristige Vorteile wie Hashtag#Innovation. Die Vorschriften müssen aktualisiert werden.2️. 𝗕ü𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗲-𝗔𝗯𝗯𝗮𝘂: Die Telko-Vorschriften sind in der Vergangenheit verhaftet. Wir regulieren Glasfasernetze immer noch wie alte Kupferinfrastrukturen, trotz intensiven Wettbewerbs. In Deutschland bauen über 250 Glasfaseranbieter Netze aus. Es ist nötig, von schwerfälligen Regeln abzurücken, um Innovationen nicht zu behindern.3️. 𝗙𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝘇𝗽𝗼𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗸: Jeder Euro für Frequenzgebühren fehlt bei Investitionen in Infrastruktur. Längere Frequenzlizenzen und mehr verfügbare Frequenzen, besonders im oberen 6-GHz-Band, sind entscheidend für den Ausbau von 5G- und zukünftigen 6G-Netzen.4️. 𝗕𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗻𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝘁 𝗳ü𝗿 𝗧𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗸𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗸𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Der Telko-Markt in der EU ist stark fragmentiert. Nationale Beschränkungen führen zu Ineffizienz. Der Telekommunikationsrahmen muss harmonisiert werden, um einen Flickenteppich unterschiedlicher Vorschriften zu vermeiden.5️. 5𝗚-𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻: Neue Dienste müssen erschlossen werden. Technologien wie Hashtag#5G Slicing könnten die Industrie verändern, aber regulatorische Unsicherheiten bremsen den Fortschritt. Wir brauchen klare Vorgaben von der EU-Kommission.6️. 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝗺 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗻 Ö𝗸𝗼𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺: Verbraucher nehmen Telko-Dienste und OTT-Plattformen wie WhatsApp gleich wahr, sollten daher ähnlich reguliert werden. Der mobile Datenverkehr wird sich bis 2030 verdreifachen. Faire kommerzielle Preise für Datentransportdienste sind notwendig, die Regulierung sollte bei unfairen Bedingungen eingreifen.7️. 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝘃𝗲𝗿ä𝗻𝗶𝘁ä𝘁: Europa ist bei über 80% seiner digitalen Infrastruktur von Drittländern abhängig. Investitionen in eigene Cloud- und KI-Kapazitäten sind unerlässlich, um strategische Schwächen zu beheben.Zeit zu handeln: Europas Telko-Industrie ist entscheidend für die digitale Transformation.

Now the response is here with the Clean Industrial Deal. My impression: a collection of individual measures – some of them quite promising – but rather vague and not really the big hit we’d need. What the commission under Ursula von der Leyen presented is too little and comes too late. Of course, we must be happy that a course correction is underway at all. Lowering energy prices, accelerating the transition to renewables, boosting clean technologies are steps in the right direction. This way we could find our way back to growth and make climate neutrality a viable business case. However, what’s missing is a true policy shift, a turnaround towards more framework and less regulation. Some key measures will only have an impact in a few years, if at all. But I’d say the final chapter has not yet been written. And fast as well as decisive measures will be key to strengthen European industry. In particular, we must ensure technology neutrality and avoid creating new bureaucratic hurdles. For this, it takes utmost determination, goodwill, and an unideological approach on all sides. We in the chemical industry are ready to make our contribution. So, let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work as quickly as possible. And, by the way, a similar attitude should guide the upcoming coalition treaty negotiations in Germany where the next federal government has to take swift, pragmatic action as well.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7300919164641173504

We achieved and, in some cases, exceeded our financial targets. We achieved the highest operating result in the company's history: Adjusted EBITDA AL amounted to 43 billion euros. We want to pay 90 cents per share, the highest dividend in Deutsche Telekom's history. Where does that come from? Because we are investing, turning customers into fans and becoming more efficient. This gives us financial figures that we can use to invest again. And that's what we've done: on both sides of the Atlantic, more than 16 billion euros last year. We are continuing to lay fiber optics for all it's worth: Over 20 million households in Germany and Europe can now book a fiber optic connection with us. And in the USA, T-Mobile has led the industry in customer growth for years.  The fact that Deutsche Telekom is where it is today - namely one of the most successful companies in the DAX and in our industry - has a lot to do with the people who work for this company.

An Berlin liebe ich sehr die Diversität, die Lebendigkeit und die Energie – vor allem und insbesondere aber, wie es uns die deutsche Geschichte bewusst macht und sowohl an die grauenvollsten Momente erinnert als auch an den Kampf für die starke Demokratie, die daraus hervorgegangen ist.Das Denkmal für die ermordeten Juden in der Nähe des Brandenburger Tors und die zerstörte Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtnis-Kirche mahnen, was Rassismus und extremistischer Nationalismus anrichten. Die Reste der Berliner Mauer zeigen, was linker Totalitarismus bedeutet. Die Tunnel an der Bernauer Straße zeugen von der unbändigen Sehnsucht nach Demokratie und Freiheit. Die gläserne Kuppel und die transparenten Gebäude des Regierungsviertels stehen für genau diese Freiheit und Demokratie im endlich geeinten Deutschland.Wenn ich am nächsten Sonntag wähle, dann mit einem Gefühl der Dankbarkeit für diese Demokratie und der Verantwortung, sie zu schützen und nicht selbstverständlich zu nehmen. Wenn ich am nächsten Sonntag wähle, dann mit der Frage im Kopf, wie ich der Generation meiner Großeltern meine Wahl erklären würde, und wie ich sie der Generation meiner (noch nicht geborenen ;-)) Enkel und Enkelinnen erklären würde.

We have strong foundations – a single market of 440 million consumers and a 17% share of global gross domestic product. But if we want to remain competitive, we need a focused industrial policy, to drive innovation, and to reduce dependencies on critical resources.

Now, it’s up to us to act.

For the next federal government for Germany, and for Europe. We are facing major challenges in Germany – concerns about the security in our country, stagnating economic growth, loss of competitiveness, the looming loss of jobs in several industries, as well as geopolitical tensions, protectionism, and the threat of tariff increases. We have reached or even surpassed a critical point. We need a stable democracy based on social-market principles. Because without a stable democracy, there is no growth and no prosperity. The federal election must therefore not be a protest election, but an election that sets a clear course.  On complex issues, such as immigration, and other questions that will have us preoccupied over multiple legislative periods, the center parties must find lasting solutions through democratic discourse. Christian, Ola, and I agree: We need a clear growth agenda for Germany and Europe – we can only achieve this Economic Miracle 2.0 together. This also means: We stand up for values like diversity, openness, and tolerance, because they are part of the foundation of a successful economy. The following points are particularly important for us for the political agenda in the coming years: Top 10-point program for Germany: 1.    Quickly reduce bureaucracy, digitize, and massively scale back regulation. A moratorium on certain laws would give us time to revise them.2.    Competitive, non-subsidized energy prices through pragmatic, intelligent energy policy.3.    Promotion of selected future technologies and support getting them to market.4.    The sustainable transformation must be receptive to technology and pragmatic.5.    Modernization of infrastructure with public and private capital.6.    Increasing the labor force potential through more incentives for work, qualified immigration, and fast, smooth integration into the labor market.7.    Significantly reduce corporate taxes.8.    Sustainably increase the defense budget and coordinate it at the European level.9.    Conclude pragmatic free-trade agreements now without overloading them.10.

Expanding this initiative isn’t just a business decision; it’s a deeply personal one. As a father, I understand the challenges of balancing work and family. No parent should have to choose between professional ambitions and family responsibilities. Every parent deserves the peace of mind that comes from knowing their children are in a safe, nurturing place to develop.The business case is equally strong: companies thrive when people thrive. Retaining top talent means creating an environment where employees can focus on their careers without sacrificing their personal lives. When we support parents, we create a stronger, more engaged workforce – and a more resilient business. On a broader scale, access to affordable, high-quality childcare is key driver of social progress, helping to break down outdated gender roles and promote true equality.A special thank you to the dedicated childcare professionals – our unsung heroes – who invest their time and talents in shaping the next generation.

Ebenso auf das Gegenstück, die Dunkelflauten, zu denen ich mich auch hier schon geäußert hatte. Beide sind besondere Phänomene, die aber mit einer gewissen Regelmäßigkeit auftreten. Bruno Burger vom Fraunhofer ISE hat es treffend zusammengefasst: Den Dunkelflauten der vergangenen Monate stehen im vergangenen Jahr insgesamt 450 Stunden mit Strompreisen unter Null gegenüber! [...]. Hier scheint mir manchmal eine verzerrte Wahrnehmung in der öffentlichen Debatte vorzuherrschen. Unbestritten weisen beide Phänomene aber auf ein grundsätzliches Problem hin, denn die Verfügbarkeit von Strom aus EE ist volatil und auch auf Tagesbasis stark schwankend. Es stellt sich daher die Frage, wie wir die Auswirkungen dieser Ereignisse optimal im Sinne bezahlbarer Energie abfedern können. Und mehr noch: wir sollten dafür sorgen, dass Kunden davon sogar profitieren. Eine Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass Stromanbieter und Stromverbraucher – bis hin zum Durchschnittshaushalt – flexibel am Strommarkt teilnehmen können. E.ON arbeitet daher an flexiblen Lösungen wie Speichern und einer gut ausgebauten Netzinfrastruktur, und wir setzen auf eine Flexibilisierung der Tarife. Als Voraussetzung dafür muss der Smart Meter Rollout aber endlich an Fahrt gewinnen und es braucht eine Anpassung des Marktdesigns. Wir brauchen einen technologieoffenen Kapazitätsmarkt, damit Kapazitäten für den Fall bereitgehalten werden, dass zu wenig Energie aus EE-Anlagen das System stützt.

In meinem Interview mit der WELT erläuterte ich die Strategie hinter der ADNOC-Übernahme, Covestros Zukunftsperspektiven und die Herausforderungen für die deutsche Industrie. Die Kernpunkte: - Die Übernahme durch ADNOC ist kein Ausverkauf, sondern eine strategische Entscheidung, die uns ermöglicht, schneller zu wachsen und in Innovationen zu investieren. - Trotz externer Schocks wie der Corona- und Energiekrise haben wir unser Portfolio stetig optimiert und in vielen Bereichen die Kostenführerschaft erreicht. - Wir reagieren auf die sinkende industrielle Nachfrage in Europa, indem wir uns anpassen und effizienter aufstellen. Alles liegt auf dem Tisch, und unser Ziel ist klar: Wir wollen in Europa der „last man standing“ sein. - Die Chemieindustrie ist grundsätzlich gesund. Unternehmen treffen gute Entscheidungen und sind im Ausland profitabel. In Europa jedoch stimmen die Rahmenbedingungen nicht, weshalb diese Strategien hier nicht aufgehen.

Der Ausbau der Erneuerbaren ist in den vergangenen zehn Jahren deutlich vorangeschritten. 2024 stammte bereits mehr als 62 Prozent der Nettostromproduktion aus erneuerbaren Quellen. Das ist zunächst mal ein Erfolg, heißt aber auch: Die Erneuerbaren sind heute wettbewerbsfähig, sie sind die tragenden Säulen in dem Erzeugungsmix und sollten auch so in die Verantwortung genommen werden. Die Betreiber von EE-Anlagen müssen sich effizient im Sinne des Systems zu verhalten. Es darf nicht sein, dass die Betreiber gesichert Einnahmen ernten, während sie ihre Preis- und Mengenrisiken auf die Allgemeinheit abwälzen. Die am Freitag verabschiedete Novelle des Energiewirtschaftsgesetzes beinhaltet eine Dämpfung von PV-Einspeisespitzen und einen Mechanismus, die Förderung bei negativen Strompreisen auszusetzen.Das sind wichtige Schritte, denn grundsätzlich sollte klar sein: Wer ungesteuert ins Netz einspeist, wenn gerade ohnehin viel Strom im System ist, der im Zweifel sogar abgeregelt werden muss und zusätzliche Kosten verursacht, sollte nicht dafür belohnt werden, dass er das Problem noch vergrößert.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7292078685891809280

Hier ein erster Vorschlag als Teil der Lösung.Ich plädiere dafür, die Vergütung für Erzeuger von erneuerbaren Energien zu ändern. Statt einer Pauschalförderung müssen sie Anreize haben, ihre Bauentscheidung auch von der verfügbaren Netzinfrastruktur abhängig zu machen. Ansonsten treiben sie völlig unnötig Systemkosten im Netz hoch, die den Strompreis belasten. Was das heißt, lässt sich zum Beispiel am Thema Abregelungskosten festmachen. Abregeln müssen Netzbetreiber dann, wenn in bestimmten Regionen oder Leitungsabschnitten zu viel Strom im Netz ist. Das kostet Geld – 2023 waren es bundesweit 3,1 Mrd. Euro für 34,3 TWh abgeregelten Strom (in etwa der Jahresverbrauch von Dänemark!). Das ist natürlich ineffizient und für die Kunden ärgerlich. Doch leider ist das beileibe keine Seltenheit, gerade wenn in ländlichen Regionen, wo kaum Abnehmer sind, ungesteuert EE-Anlagen hinzugebaut werden. Aus systemischer Sicht sollten daher in Zukunft Erneuerbare vorrangig da gebaut werden, wo sie auch zu vertretbaren Kosten auf Basis einer bestehenden Netzinfrastruktur integriert werden können. Und wer woanders baut, bekommt eben keine Kompensation bei Abregelung (Redispatchvorbehalt).",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7290731507210493955

Wir haben über die Themen gesprochen, die uns allen auf den Nägeln brennen: Energiewende und Bürokratie, Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Innovationskraft, Europa im neuen Spiel der Mächte. Ich habe deutlich gemacht, dass 2025 in meinen Augen ein entscheidendes Jahr sein wird – für Deutschland und Europa. Der Energiewende kommt hierbei eine tragende Rolle zu. E.ON bekennt sich zur Energiewende. Denn dies ist sowohl ökologisch wie ökonomisch der sinnvollste Weg. Wir müssen uns aber Gedanken machen, WIE wir die Energiewende angehen.- Erstens: Unsere Energiepolitik muss bedarfs- und marktorientierter sowie pragmatischer werden. Weg vom planwirtschaftlichen Ansatz mit Detailzielen. Dieses unflexible Vorgehen macht es am Ende für Kunden unverhältnismäßig und unnötig teuer.- Zweitens: Erneuerbare sind heute marktfähig. Deshalb sollten wir schnell entscheiden, wie wir sie in den Markt „entlassen“. Und natürlich gehört dazu auch, dass die Investoren in Erneuerbare selbst Verantwortung übernehmen und ihre Mengen- und Preisrisiken tragen, statt die Folgen und Kosten ihres Handelns einfach über das Netz zu sozialisieren. - Drittens: Die Digitalisierung der Energieinfrastruktur ist ein entscheidender Hebel für mehr Effizienz und Flexibilität. Ein flächendeckender Rollout von Smart Metern ist eine Grundvoraussetzung, um dynamische und flexible Tarife in jeden Haushalt zu bringen. Das hilft dem Netz und dem Portemonnaie der Menschen.- Viertens: Die politischen Verantwortungsträger verstehen, dass es insbesondere in der Energiepolitik weniger um Einzelmaßnahmen auf gesetzgeberischer Ebene geht. Was wir brauchen, ist eine allgemeine Kurskorrektur in Richtung weniger Bürokratie, weniger Dirigismus, und stattdessen mehr Innovation, damit die Energiewende eine Erfolgsgeschichte wird.Wir bei E.ON verstehen und als Playmaker der Energiewende und werden diese mit der Bereitstellung der Energieinfrastruktur und unseren Kundenlösungen auch im Jahr 2025 voranbringen. hashtag#playmaker",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7289564433901604864

This year, the event’s taking place under the theme “collaboration for the intelligent age” and true to this spirit, it’s been a great opportunity to meet with customers, partners, government representatives, and media from around the world.  As we get ready to leave Davos, there’s a clear sense of excitement around the potential of Hashtag#AgenticAI, both for business and society as a whole. AI is a major lever to address the challenges facing the world today. Last year at SAP, we delivered over 130 Gen AI use cases for every business function, from Supply Chain to Finance. Now, with the emergence of agentic AI capabilities, we’re at the start of an exciting new chapter. AI Agents can support and mirror human collaboration, working together to combine their expertise and perform multi-step workflows across end-to-end business processes. Imagine, for example, sales agents that not only drive demand but communicate that increase to supply chain agents, which in turn collaborate with procurement agents to make sure the needed materials are delivered on time.  At the end of this week, it’s also very clear that there are still many questions we need to answer to ensure we have everything we need to best unleash this potential. To go back to the Hashtag#WEF25's motto, collaboration – across departments, companies, and borders – is absolutely key for the intelligent age. Especially here in Europe, this is the moment when the EU must join forces and fully focus on digitalization and technology. Overregulation and fragmented markets can only hinder our ability to innovate.

Leo Birnbaum,2025-01-02 10:36:28,Text + Photo,post,post,562,9,5,"In recent years, we in Europe have spent a lot of time thinking about “how” we want to live. In 2025, we need to find answers to the question of “what” we want to live on. Because for Europe to continue to offer us protection and an intact living environment in the future, we need growth and a functioning business model. However, this requires us to face reality and sit down as a society. To achieve more growth, we need to work harder, invest more and finally become bolder - for example in the use of future technologies such as artificial intelligence. The positive thing is that the chances of a real new start are not so bad. The new European Commission wants to concentrate fully on increasing European competitiveness in its new term of office. In doing so, it will be important that it does not fall back into old patterns of dirigisme and planned economy. After a total of 13,000 legal acts adopted in the past four years, it will have to be reminded of this.In Germany, new elections could save us almost 8 months of paralyzing gridlock and superfluous election campaigns. Instead, a courageous government will then have the chance to implement real, perhaps painful, reforms so that Germany can relinquish the red lantern in terms of economic growth among the G7 countries and finally become a European economic engine.A secure, sustainable and affordable energy supply remains a pillar of a strong economy. And we must finally abandon the naive idea that it is enough to simply place wind turbines and PV systems in the landscape.“Why” was shown in a particularly drastic way by the Central European dark doldrums – in German we call in Dunkelflauten – in November and December 2024, which were unusual in their severity but not in their nature. Exchange electricity prices shot up within a few hours to around ten times the usual price. This has created a greater understanding of the fact that our energy system is still far from being equipped for the volatility of renewables – not just in such extreme situations, but in general. The result is rising inefficiencies and system costs, which will increasingly become an economic burden if we do not take countermeasures. The willingness to invest in an energy transition 2.0 is there. E.ON alone is planning to drive forward the modernization and expansion of the energy infrastructure from 2024 to 2028 with investments of €42 billion. However, we also have to earn our investments first. In a weakening economy, attractive regulatory and political framework conditions are therefore all the more important. The same applies here as for economic policy in general: if we want innovation and digitalization, we need economic incentives instead of bureaucratic hurdles and small-scale targets.In other words: We need to work together, especially now in this difficult environment, to ensure that new energy works. That would be at least a partial answer to the question of how we want to live in the future.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7280532394833588225

But instead of dwelling on what has gone wrong, let's look at the successes that can give us confidence for the new year. Here are a few that stuck with me.Mobility: Global electric car sales surged in the first quarter of 2024, increasing by 25% compared to the same period in 2023.

Hier ein paar Buchempfehlungen von mir zum Abschluss des Jahres:- Die „Apologie des Sokrates“ von Plato: Zeitloser Gewinn für den Geist. Habe ich neulich statt der letzten Fassung der EnWG Novelle gelesen und mich dann besser gefühlt. - „Metro 2033“ von Dimitry Glukhovsky: Liest sich wie ein düsterer Science-Fiction Roman von Dostojewski vermengt mit beißender Gesellschaftskritik und lässt den Leser am Ende komplett sprachlos zurück. - „The World for Sale“ der Investigativjournalisten Blas und Farchy: Die wenig bekannte Geschichte der Commoditytrader und ihrer Rolle in der Entwicklung der Weltwirtschaft über die letzten Jahrzehnte. Herausragend recherchiert und geschrieben!- „The coming wave“ von Mustafa Suleyman: Hier geht es um AI und was das für die Menschheit bedeutet. Wenige können zu diesem Diskurs mehr beitragen als der Co-Founder von Deepmind. - „Athen oder Sparta“ von Wolfgang Will: Thukydides habe ich wohl gelesen aber die Geschichte des peloponnesischen Krieges nie verstanden.

Oliver Bäte,2024-12-27 08:00:18,Text + Photo,post,post,1549,30,29,"Business leaders like Allianz have a dual responsibility: first, to look over the horizon to shape and secure the future of society and those we serve, and second, to look inward at how our values align with our actions.  The disciplines of sustainability and diversity demonstrate how these principles work together, integrating our values with actions in support of our long-term business strategy. For this reason, both topics were part of my presentation to the capital markets this month. Since then, we have received further recognition for not just promises, but results.  The Dow Jones Sustainability Index once again selected our company as one of the top sustainable companies in the insurance industry. Further, with a score of 89 out of 100 in the 2024 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, investors can gauge how deeply sustainability is embedded in our strategy and operations. Similarly, a diverse workforce, balanced leadership, and an inclusive talent strategy are also seen as a strong signal of management quality. This is because a wide range of perspectives in our workforce enable us to innovate, judge wisely, and address complex global challenges in a holistic way. Diversity by design has been a priority of my tenure as CEO, and it was a moment of great pride when this month, four of my colleagues on the Allianz SE Board of Management were recognized among the 100 most influential women in German business by manager magazin and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Most special to me, they were recognized as a team. Congratulations to Sirma Boshnakova, Claire-Marie Coste-Lepoutre, Barbara Karuth-Zelle, and particularly to Renate Wagner, who is the Board Member who has People & Culture as part of her portfolio of responsibilities, for being named ""Prima Inter Pares"" on this esteemed list! Such success stories don’t come by chance. They are the result of a long-term strategy to encourage and develop female leadership, supported by measures such as monitoring targets or growing mentoring and sponsorship networks. 44% of Allianz SE Board members are women – the highest ratio among DAX-40 companies. Women constitute 52% of our staff and 34% of our top managers. These are results shaped by “inclusive meritocracy” – we create opportunities for more people, but to get to the top, you have to deliver.  Our convictions motivate us, but our actions define us. This month showed that our efforts in sustainability and diversity, and self-reinforcing, and an intelligent approach to both helps us create meaningful value for our customer and shareholders.  We see diversity, also encompassing dimensions by generation, religion, sexual orientation, nationality and ethnic backgrounds, not only as a moral imperative, but as a practical one that underpins our sustainability efforts and helps us drive meaningful outcomes for our customers while building a more resilient, and secure future.

Tim Höttges,2024-12-19 11:23:34,Text + Album,post,post,1466,51,51,"Vor 75 Jahren wurde das Grundgesetz verabschiedet. Es ist die DNA unserer Demokratie. Für mich ist das Grundgesetz zudem unser im Alltag oft „unsichtbarer Superheld“, der unsere Freiheit ermöglicht und unsere Demokratie gut „im Griff“ hält. Um unser Grundgesetz sichtbarer zu machen und Impulse für unser Zusammenleben zu setzen, hat die Initiative Hashtag#DNAofDemocracy u.a. ein besonderes Buchprojekt gestartet. Die Tinte für dieses Buch hat „es“ in sich. Nämlich das Grundgesetz - als DNA-Micropartikel. Auch ich war eingeladen, mich an dem Buch zu beteiligen und den Satz „Demokratie muss…“ zu ergänzen.Mein erster Impuls war - im Sinne von Lessings Nathan dem Weisen („Kein Mensch muss müssen“) – zu schreiben: Demokratie muss gar nichts. Sie ist erfolgreiches Mittel zum Zweck. Und dieser Zweck ist es unter anderem, Freiheit, persönliche Entfaltung, Gemeinschaft und vieles mehr möglich zu machen. Ihr Zweck ist, jedem eine Stimme zu geben. Auch Minderheiten zu schützen. Konsens zu finden für eine Gesellschaft, die gemeinschaftlich entscheidet, wie wir Gemeinwohl gestalten.Und doch bin ich überzeugt: Demokratie muss Wohlstand schaffen. Etwa, weil ohne materielle Absicherung freiheitliche Entfaltung schwer denkbar ist. Aber wohl vor allem, weil Demokratie ohne Wohlstand die Anhänger verliert, die sie zum Selbsterhalt braucht. Wohlstand sichert somit nicht nur persönliche Bedürfnisse. Sondern Wohlstand sichert ein Gemeinwesen, das Rechtsstaatlichkeit, Freiheit, Menschenwürde, Teilhabe aber auch Schutz vor staatlicher Willkür garantiert. Also all das, was wir in unserem Grundgesetz gemeinsam verfasst haben. Gute Wirtschaftspolitik ist darum immer auch gute Demokratiepolitik.Gutes Wirtschaften – und das ist ein Auftrag an Unternehmen – kann so gesehen ein Beitrag zu Demokratie sein. The business of business ist also nicht nur business. Sondern immer: business mit purpose. Es geht einher mit sozialer, ja sogar demokratischer Verantwortung. Darum engagiert sich die Deutsche Telekom stets über den Shareholder Value, der übrigens Wohlstand schafft, hinaus.Dazu zählt Artikel 1 unseres Grundgesetzes. Denn auch die „digitale Würde des Menschen“ muss unantastbar sein und vor staatlichen und privaten Akteuren geschützt werden. Auch die virtuelle Welt muss entlang der Werte organisiert sein, die wir in unserem Grundgesetz verfasst haben. Dafür setzen wir als Telekom uns ein und setzen darum Zeichen etwa gegen „Hass im Netz“ oder mit der Kampagne „Nachricht von Ella“ zum Schutz von Persönlichkeitsrechten unserer Kinder.Demokratie muss nicht. Aber sie kann und leistet so vieles. Darum müssen wir! Uns für sie einsetzen. Uns engagieren. Nicht nur kritisieren, sondern: Machen!Ein Hoch auf unser Grundgesetz, unseren verlässlichen Hüter.Hashtag#demokratiemuss",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7275470818069872640

Fakt ist aber: Wir Deutschen arbeiten heute im OECD-Vergleich am wenigsten! Und das, obwohl wir gleichzeitig zum Beispiel gegenüber den USA seit den 90er Jahren Jahr für Jahr an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit verlieren. Das heißt im Klartext: Das Arbeitsangebot in Deutschland wird immer knapper, weil wir immer weniger Stunden arbeiten. Und das, was wir mit der geleisteten Arbeitsstunde erreichen, erzielt im Vergleich zu anderen Ländern immer weniger Wertschöpfung. Beides können wir uns schlicht und einfach nicht mehr leisten. Solange wir nicht produktiver werden, kann Deutschland seine Wettbewerbsfähigkeit nur steigern, wenn wir wieder deutlich mehr arbeiten. Die geringe Arbeitszeit ist das Ergebnis im internationalen Vergleich geringer Wochenarbeitszeiten, hoher Urlaubsansprüche, hoher Krankenstände und hoher Teilzeitquote. Das sind alles keine gottgegebenen Gründe. Zum Beispiel zur Teilzeitquote: Selbst da, wo Vollzeit familiär möglich ist, kommen viele Paare zu dem Ergebnis, dass sich Vollzeitarbeit für beide Partner gar nicht lohnt. Weil am Ende von dem Mehr an Brutto Netto praktisch kaum etwas übrigbleibt. Wir müssen umsteuern. Arbeit muss sich lohnen. Das ist in Deutschland Ende 2024 leider keine Plattitüde, sondern ein Handlungsauftrag an eine künftige Bundesregierung. Mit dem Ausscheiden der Babyboomer sinkt das Angebot potenzieller Arbeitskräfte noch weiter. Auch deshalb muss die Pro-Kopf-Arbeitszeit wieder steigen, wenn wir vom Fleck kommen wollen.

New Commission, new faces, and new impetus to act on the challenges standing before us. Now it’s time to turn words into action. What does that mean concretely? Firstly, we need to unlock the huge amounts of investments required for our energy transition. Evolving the Capital Markets Union into a complete Savings & Investments Union, bolstering the mandates of the EIB & ECB and de-risking investments across the board are essential. Failure to do so will simply make Europe less competitive and less able to invest.We also need more implementation on the ground: much, much more. The targets are in place and there should be no excuse for not getting the job done. At E.ON we’re taking up that challenge. We have to make 8 million connections at the DSO level, 1 every 7 seconds between now and 2030, to meet targets. The numbers are high but not unique to E.ON and it’s on all of us to use these years to implement our promises.Distribution grid infrastructure is at risk of becoming the bottleneck of the transition if we don’t build quick enough. Sometimes there seems to be a preference to rather build less than too much – let’s be clear it will not be possible to build too much given how much electrification is coming our way. Cut the permitting time and let’s get building!One final word on bureaucracy. The EU has been fond of regulating for decades. As pointed out by Mario Draghi in his report, since 2019 the EU had passed around 13,000 pieces of legislation, compared to 3,000 in the United States.

Yesterday, we met with members of the new European Commission and representatives of the European Wind Value Chain. Here we discussed key actions Europe needs to take on wind to enhance competitiveness and economic resilience.Four points I want to highlight:⏩ Drive fair Competition: We need criteria that reflect local value creation, R&D work in Europe, resilience, and cybersecurity in the evaluation of tender processes. A pure price-driven competition will not sustain a European wind industry. ⏩ A balanced business model for Wind: Europe must increase wind power capacity to 425 GW by 2030, adding 200 GW in six years and requiring investment of up to €400 billion. Such an investment will only materialize if there is a profitable business model for both investors and supply chain companies. This, in turn, will require competitive financing costs and derisking elements such as counter guarantees. ⏩ We need innovation and implementation: The close interlink between innovating and manufacturing is essential to be resilient. Innovation is the entry ticket into a market, but it needs a manufacturing base in Europe to be successful.⏩ General boundary conditions for industry: A reduction of complexity and bureaucracy also helps the wind industry. A key focus needs to be on the productivity of doing business in Europe. We will not get a second shot at this.

It's well-known that the industrial sector is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, responsible for over 1/3 of global emissions in 2019. A significant portion of these emissions comes from using electricity and heat. This is particularly true for energy-intensive industries like chemicals and metals, which contribute considerably to indirect emissions. However, what’s often overlooked is the industry's critical role in reducing emissions across various sectors, not just its own. Let's take the chemical and plastics industry as an example: In transportation, plastics are pivotal in the development of electric vehicles. Lightweight polycarbonate components help conserve battery life, increasing the range. This accelerates the transition from combustion engines to alternative drives, significantly cutting greenhouse gas emissions in mobility.In the construction sector, plastics contribute to making housing more climate-friendly and affordable. Rigid polyurethane foam serves as an excellent insulator, drastically reducing energy consumption for heating and cooling in buildings.Plastics also drive the energy transformation. Coatings for rotor blades or submarine cable sheathing help make wind turbines more robust against environmental influences, enhancing their durability and extending maintenance intervals.So, we find ourselves at a turning point, with the power to both impact and resolve climate challenge. By continuing our focus on innovation and a circular economy, we can transform the industrial sector into a beacon of climate solutions and further reduce our own emissions.

The last 5-year plans in Europe did all not work.  „… (b) a description of decarbonisation levers identified and key actions planned to reach the targets referred to in point (a), including, where appropriate, changes in the product and service portfolio of the company and the adoption of new technologies; (c) an explanation and quantification of the investments and funding supporting the implementation […]; ….”  Whoever wrote this did never run a company.

Without a competitive environment, Europe risks losing its leadership in circular plastic innovations, which would have tremendous consequences for the downstream value chain.Plastics play a crucial role in key areas such as energy, mobility, and construction. Some examples: Plastics in wind turbines increase speed and therefore productivity. Lightweight polycarbonate components in electric cars conserve batteries and increase range. Innovative building materials made from plastics save energy and thus reduce CO2 emissions.That's why I continue to advocate for a hashtag#CircularEconomy for plastics.

Our customers and shareholders tells us that they see polarization as damaging to their economic prosperity and their personal wealth.

Allianz will support people with guidance on how to identify and act on fake news, defuse tension through respectful listening and debate, and maintain confidence during uncertainty. Our approach is supported by research and insight. The 2024 Allianz Social Resilience Index explores in depth the global state of polarization and serves to quantify the impact of various socio-economic factors on societies, from the immediate costs of social unrest to how it stifles global growth and consumer confidence.Experience and history are also part of the solution.

Geopolitical tensions are reshaping the global order, economic uncertainty is disrupting industries worldwide, and the urgent need to combat climate change is forcing industries to rethink operations at every level. The call for Hashtag#transformation across industries and borders has never been louder. For us at thyssenkrupp, this is not only a necessity but an opportunity to redefine what we stand for and what we can achieve together.  Today, at our Hashtag#AnnualPressConference 2024, we reflected on the progress we have made in the fiscal year 2023/24 and outlined the path forward.  Despite weaker market demand, we met sales (€35 billion) and adjusted EBIT (€567 million) targets, exceeding Free Cash Flow before M&A (€110 million). We will propose an unchanged dividend of €0.15 per share. But that is not enough for us; we aim higher. Our APEX 2.0 initiative continues to drive efficiency across the company, helping us focus on what matters most: delivering value to our shareholders and building a resilient future. Hashtag#performance A key focus the past fiscal year was the realignment of our portfolio to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving global economy. Hashtag#portfoliothyssenkrupp Steel: Aiming for CO2-reduced steel production with a 20% stake already acquired by Hashtag#EPCG, progressing towards a 50/50 joint venture.thyssenkrupp Marine Systems: Strong order books and strategic standalone positioning opportunities are progressing. The focus remains on a spin-off, with ongoing discussions regarding potential state involvement.thyssenkrupp Automotive & thyssenkrupp Materials Services: Embracing innovation and partnerships, including development collaboration with the Chinese BWI group and our “Materials as a Service” strategy. The green transformation is not just a goal for us – it is our responsibility. In steel, our sustainable solutions will set new standards for emission-free production, while automotive products like rotor shafts and new refrigerative compressor using natural refrigerants shape tomorrow's mobility. Green supply chains are at the heart of our digital solutions from thyssenkrupp Materials Services. And, thyssenkrupp Decarbon Technologies transforms industrial green transformation with modular products and service expansion in the fields of carbon capture solutions, green ammonia & methanol, cost-efficient wind power systems, and thyssenkrupp nucera's scalable green hydrogen technologies. One point of pride: we invested €690 million in R&D last fiscal year, solidifying our place as one of Germany's top research-driven tech companies. Hashtag#greentransformation Fiscal year 2024/25 will focus on steady growth, green transformation, and crucial portfolio decisions. This would not be possible without the dedication of our Hashtag#GENERATIONTK, and trust of our Hashtag#shareholders.

Das ist nicht nur ein deutlicher Anstieg im Vergleich zum Vorjahr, sondern auch ein klares Signal, dass die Erwartungen an Unternehmen steigen – und wir diesen gerecht werden müssen. Weniger Worte, mehr Taten. Eine Entwicklung, die ich sehr begrüße. Besonders stolz bin ich auf die Fortschritte in der Chemieindustrie, denn die Herausforderungen in unserer Branche sind enorm. Energieintensive Prozesse, vielfältige Rohstoffe, strenge Sicherheitsvorschriften und komplexe globale Wertschöpfungsketten machen Nachhaltigkeitsinitiativen besonders anspruchsvoll. Und trotzdem zeigen Unternehmen wie Beiersdorf und Covestro ihre Entschlossenheit, den eingeschlagenen Weg der Transformation konsequent weiterzuverfolgen. Bei Covestro setzen wir auf den ökonomisch besten Pfad, bis 2035 in Scope 1 und 2 klimaneutral zu werden. Durch Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) haben wir beispielsweise 2023 bereits 16 Prozent unseres weltweiten Strombedarfs aus erneuerbaren Energien gedeckt. Das ist ein signifikanter Schritt, aber bei weitem nicht das Ende unserer Bemühungen. Die Studie der Union Investment zeigt, dass selbst in wirtschaftlich herausfordernden Zeiten erhebliche Fortschritte im Klimaschutz möglich sind.

Die Transformation des Energiesystems aber muss und wird in den kommenden Jahren weiter voranschreiten – und dies unabhängig von Regierungskonstellationen und einzelnen Wahlergebnissen. Ein zentraler Erfolgsfaktor für ihr Gelingen ist Flexibilität, d.h. die Befähigung von Nutzern unterschiedlicher Technologien, Bezug und Einspeisung an volatile Rahmenbedingungen anzupassen. Dies als neue Normalität zu begreifen – darum ging es gestern Abend bei unserem E.ON Spitzengespräch in Berlin, zu dem es mich sehr gefreut hat, Herrn Staatssekretär Dr. Philipp Nimmermann und Digitalexperte Sascha Lobo zu begrüßen. Wie motiviert man Verbraucherinnen und Verbraucher zur Nutzung von Flexibilitätslösungen? Welche Anreize brauchen Mittelstand und Großindustrie? Was sind die gesellschaftspolitischen Herausforderungen? Welche politischen Weichen müssen wir jetzt stellen? Folgende Punkte stehen für mich in Vordergrund: 1. Flexibilität braucht passgenaue Anreize und einen gut moderierten TransformationsprozessFlexibilität ist kein Nice-to-have, sondern ein absolutes Must-have. Je schneller wir Flexibilität implementieren, desto früher erreichen wir auch unsere Klimaziele.  Dazu braucht es Stringenz in den Anreizen für Industrie und Haushalte. Nötig ist ein Transformationsprozess, der Entscheidungs- und Investitionszyklen von Unternehmen berücksichtigt. Die geplante Flex-Agenda 2025 des BMWK sollte dazu schnellstmöglich mit Leben gefüllt werden. 2. Wir brauchen mehr Mut bei InnovationMit einer Null-Risiko-Politik kommen wir nicht voran. Wir brauchen einen flexiblen Regulierungsansatz, der Chancen erkennt und Räume für Entwicklungen zulässt. Keinen statischen, der sich auf Risiken fokussiert und Argwohn vor Innovationen ausdrückt.3. Komplexitäten müssen reduziert werdenWir brauchen mehr Transparenz und Verständlichkeit in den Prozessen und mehr Pragmatismus in der Umsetzung.

We showed DSOs must double investments to deploy the robust power grid which Europe needs to get a firm grasp of our energy security. At the exact same time, the Commissioner-designate for Energy Dan Jørgensen was laying out similar priorities in the parliamentary hearings.  I made 3 key points. Firstly the growth of electrification is key, for Europe’s decarbonisation, security and our economy. The electrification rate has stagnated across the continent, around 23% for the last decade or so, and its growth is intimately linked to Europe’s competitiveness. I welcome the early indications of the incoming Commission that this will be a focus of their work. How we finance this expansion will also be crucial. We have to find the balance between the expectations of capital markets and the ability of consumers to pay. Access to private capital is key, so regulation has to allow us to compete for investors and win. If we get this right then the role of public funding should only be complementary. Finally I would have a simple message: the responsibility is on us, as a sector, to deliver this. We do not shy away from our role to secure the necessary equipment, attract talent and investors. Society expects us to deliver and we must do so.

However, we need the right conditions: more affordable Hashtag#energy prices and a reliable infrastructure for Hashtag#hydrogen transport. This is where the government and the EU must take decisive action. While I see subsidies as essential to support the transition phase, they shouldn’t be a permanent measure.

Here are my key takeaways on what it will take to push forward the Hashtag#greentransformation: 1️⃣ The role of governments, industry, and financial institutions: Achieving net-zero emissions is an urgent, shared responsibility. Governments play a crucial role by implementing supportive frameworks and incentives, for example, by developing transportation infrastructure like pipelines and storage systems. Success requires Hashtag#collaboration with industry and the financial sector to bridge the funding gap. This helps to create blueprints for large-scale rollouts needed to demonstrate the business case and enhance the bankability of subsequent projects. 2️⃣ Leveraging partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region: Germany’s strength in green hydrogen technology opens doors for impactful partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region. By providing cutting-edge solutions for the entire value chain and fostering long-term local partnerships, thyssenkrupp supports the region’s Hashtag#decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors. Our engineering expertise, combined with procurement and construction from the Asia-Pacific region, has created integrated supply chains that serve both local goals and global ambitions for Hashtag#sustainability. 3️⃣ Sustainable financing mechanisms: Asia-Pacific nations are advancing initiatives like the “Just Energy Transition Partnership” in Indonesia & Vietnam and India’s “National Green Hydrogen Mission” that emphasize governmental commitment to decarbonization. Germany can support cross-border investments through its financial institutions, while they help achieve emission targets via carbon credits. In general, financing costs need to be lowered in all three phases of Hashtag#greenhydrogen (feedstock, production, and distribution) to help the first projects take off. Therefore, sustainable Hashtag#finance has evolved beyond traditional models. Green bonds, blended finance, and cross-border carbon accounting mechanisms are key to success.  4️⃣ Navigating global supply chains amid geopolitical forces: As regulations tighten, decarbonizing Hashtag#supplychains becomes essential. Through our knowledge, we can support Asia-Pacific economies in establishing parallel, sustainable supply chains that align with international standards, ensuring resilience and market access. Innovative financing and technology transfer will be critical here. Thank you for the great exchange, and Isabelle Körner for the outstanding moderation. The momentum is there.

Meine 2 Cents 👇Letzte Woche hat Robert Habeck die ersten hashtag#Klimaschutzverträge an Industrieunternehmen übergeben. Das Versprechen: ""Wir machen den Standort über ihre Unternehmen attraktiv für Produktion gerade in diesem so schwierigen und umkämpften Bereich in Deutschland"", so der Wirtschaftsminister.Deutschland setzt als erster EU-Mitgliedsstaat Klimaschutzverträge um – zweifellos ein Meilenstein auf dem Weg in Richtung klimaneutrale Industrie. Allerdings sehe ich die Subventionen nicht als Allheilmittel, auf dem wir uns die nächsten Jahre ausruhen können. Die Klimaschutzverträge sind vielmehr der erste Schritt eines Marathonlaufs.Das Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action strebt mit der Förderung an, die Produktion in Deutschland wieder attraktiver zu gestalten. Ein attraktiver hashtag#Wirtschaftsstandort erfordert allerdings mehr als nur Fördergelder: Wir müssen die Energiekosten senken und die Steuerlast verringern, um langfristig wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben. Um den Anschluss den internationalen Anschluss nicht zu verlieren, muss Deutschland dringend strategische Investitionen in Infrastruktur tätigen. Gleichzeitig müssen wir weiter drastisch Bürokratie abbauen – auch bei den Klimaschutzverträgen selbst. Indem wir beispielsweise die Klimaschutzverträge für industrielle Prozesswärme öffnen, vereinfachen wir den Zugang zur Förderung und erweitern so unser Potential, CO₂ zu vermeiden. Nur durch eine ausgewogene Kombination dieser Maßnahmen können wir die Industrie wirklich zukunftsfähig machen und den Wirtschaftsstandort Deutschland halten.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7255240877424394240

Bidirektionales Laden von Elektroautos wird hierbei eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Warum? Weil Elektroautos dann künftig nicht nur Strom verbrauchen, sondern dank dieser Technologie auch ins Stromnetz zurückspeisen können. Das hilft dabei, die Elektromobilität attraktiver zu machen, denn die Kunden können mit der zurückgespeisten Energie Geld sparen. Zusätzlich wird die Energiewende unterstützt, und mit den richtigen Rahmenbedingungen können die Netze effizient genutzt und die Systemkosten verringert werden. Damit das bidirektionale Laden ein Erfolg wird, müssen wir branchenübergreifend zusammenarbeiten. Daher habe ich mich heute mit Vertreterinnen und Vertretern der Automobilindustrie und der Energiewirtschaft zu einem Roundtable auf Einladung von Bundeswirtschaftsminister Robert Habeck in Berlin getroffen. Gemeinsam hat die Industrie dem Bundeswirtschaftsministerium einen Abschlussbericht mit Handlungsempfehlungen übergeben, damit bidirektionales Laden in den nächsten Jahren seine Potenziale entfalten kann. Wir sind uns einig, dass jetzt die Rahmenbedingungen gesetzt werden müssen. Das umfasst unter anderem die folgenden Punkte: - Netzdienlichkeit gewährleisten, d. h. das bidirektionale Laden muss die Kosten im Verteilnetz senken. - Standardisierung der Technik und branchenübergreifender Datenaustausch. - Wirtschaftlichkeit ermöglichen: Doppelbelastung durch Steuern, Abgaben und Umlagen abschaffen.

Unseren Kundinnen und Kunden ist der Empfang im Zug wichtig. Zurecht! Sie wollen dort telefonieren, streamen, arbeiten aber auch Freizeit genießen. Das geht jetzt deutlich besser!Vor drei Jahren haben wir uns mit der Deutsche Bahn zusammengetan, um den Empfang an Bord zu verbessern. Die erste Bilanz ist positiv. 💪 Und Kunden der Telekom, die in unserem Netz unterwegs sind, merken das. 99 Prozent der Hauptstrecken sind mit einer Bandbreite von mindestens 200 Mbit/s versorgt, auf 95 Prozent dieser Strecken bieten wir sogar 300 Mbit/s oder mehr an. Dafür haben wir in den vergangenen drei Jahren 470 neue Mobilfunkmasten gebaut und 1.900 Masten modernisiert. Eine enorme Steigerung gibt es auch bei der 200 Mbit/s-Versorgung sogenannter fahrgaststarker Strecken (13.800 Kilometer). Dort sind jeweils täglich mehr als 2.000 Fahrgäste unterwegs. Die Versorgung ist von 73 auf heute 94 Prozent gestiegen.Das Signal muss aber nicht nur an die Strecke, sondern auch in den Zug. Und das ist nicht so einfach. Darum hat die Deutsche Bahn über 70.000 Zugscheiben gelasert. So kommen die Mobilfunksignale besser in den Wagon. Dank dafür an Dr. Richard Lutz und das Team der DB! Dadurch wurde die Zahl der Züge, die guten Empfang ermöglichen, deutlich gesteigert.Wir haben schon viel bewegt. Aber es gibt noch mehr zu tun. Auch wenn das oft mühsam ist:🏞️Zum Beispiel in Nationalparks. Siehe Müritz-Nationalpark. Dort hat es rund zehn Jahre gedauert; aber wir haben uns mit den Naturschutzbehörden geeinigt und können auch dort bald bauen.🚇 Oder bei Tunneln. Die können wir nur ausbauen, wenn kein Zug fährt. 400 Tunnel haben wir ausgebaut, 100 noch besser versorgt. Aber auch hier strengen wir uns weiter an. Wenn wir kooperieren, geht es leichter. Wir machen weiter. Und wollen die Strecken noch besser versorgen. Mein persönlicher Tipp: Gehen Sie direkt mit dem eigenen Handy ins Netz. Gerade dann, wenn Sie in einem Zug mit den modernen Scheiben sitzen. Wenn man genau hinschaut, erkennt man die. hashtag#Telekom hashtag#DeutscheBahn hashtag#Netzausbau",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7247903336488734720

That was the case when I listened to the audiobook “Tunnel 29” by Helena Merriman, a riveting true story of how 29 people escaped to freedom beneath the Berlin Wall and its implications for the Cold War. Ms. Merriman originally produced “Tunnel 29” as a podcast series during her time with BBC News. Compiling extraordinary details from firsthand interviews with survivors, thousands of Stasi files, as well as maps and news reports, she weaves a thrilling account of post-war Germany including: the construction of both the Berlin Wall and the 135-meter-long Tunnel 29, the constant dangers faced by the tunnellers, the interesting involvement of American TV, and the subsequent daring escape of men, women, and children from East Berlin, and how their lives unfolded afterwards. I was completely drawn into the story. I also appreciated learning about a facet of German history from an outsider's perspective, especially what the great city of hashtag#Berlin has endured over time. Most importantly, I respected how Ms. Merriman portrays the people of “Tunnel 29”, their resourcefulness in the quest for freedom, and their perseverance. It serves as an important reminder of the tremendous sacrifices made by those before us, so that we can live as we do today.

To succeed, however, the concerns and desires of customers and electorates must be at the forefront of decision-makers’ minds. Larry and I agree that we also need to focus on the future, not on the past. There is no room for nostalgia or to rest on past achievements. Instead, if we view our current challenges as opportunities, with a healthy dose of pragmatism, they can become the foundation of a better economic future. We already see the potential. As risks increase, technical excellence will continue to deliver competitive insurance solutions. And, as Larry pointed out, the development of wider and deeper capital markets will contribute to risk mitigation by defusing risks and reducing price volatility.Yesterday’s frank discussion also addressed what leaders can do to rebuild trust and fight the polarization caused by what I call “change fatigue.” Change, while inevitable and often necessary, has to connect to the real needs of citizens. Delivering on basic quality of life issues, like healthcare, education, and affordable housing, is the most effective way to counter populist rhetoric and empty promises. Now is the time for serious dialogue and pragmatic solutions that work to restore stability, encourage optimism, and re-ignite global growth. We cannot expect governments alone to solve all these issues. Business can be part of the solution. That’s why Larry and I both emphasized the willingness and necessity of business to contribute to public-private partnerships. In our experience, such partnerships have been effective in finding pragmatic common ground, whether at the local, national, or international level. Thank you Larry Fink for your insights, Francine Lacqua for guiding our meaningful discussion, and Berlin Global Dialogue organizers for creating this opportunity. I look forward to continuing the conversation and exploring how businesses can work together with governments to help navigate rising risks and drive sustainable, inclusive growth. hashtag#BGD2024 hashtag#Allianz",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7247158502614257664

An achievement, considering that around 80% of Britain’s power demand in 1990 was covered by coal. In this regard, the UK is a frontrunner in what many countries around the world are transitioning towards: net-zero. The energy void left by coal is being filled by greener alternatives such as wind, solar, and gas … yes, that is correct, gas.When discussing decarbonization today, gas plays a crucial role in reducing CO2 emissions. Since 2010, the switch from coal to gas has saved around 500 million tons of CO2 globally – the equivalent of putting 200 million electric vehicles running on zero-carbon electricity on the road during that same time frame. Today, gas turbines are becoming more and more fuel-flexible, which means they can be operated not only with natural gas but also with co-firing green hydrogen once sufficient infrastructure and supply chains are in place. Gas, therefore, is and will remain an important piece of the puzzle to meet growing energy demand and be an element of a sustainable energy system.hashtag#energytransition hashtag#coaltogasshift hashtag#uk",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7246899896824324098

In markets with a strong bias toward capital markets, like the U.S., we see significantly higher long-term asset growth. While financial assets in Western Europe have doubled in the last two decades (+104%), for instance, the increase in the USA is a whopping 178%, bolstered by favorable market developments. The report’s analysis of the diversity in saving behaviors across markets and generations provides important insight into potential future trends.Despite an encouraging uptick in global net financial assets growth, we’re reminded that crisis and political uncertainty continue to create volatility that threatens to drag down savings growth potential for millions of people – a fact that reinforces the need for reports like this one that go beyond the headlines and help us understand the long-term data trends and underlying factors impacting wealth formation.

But it is only half the truth. Here’s why:On the one hand, several studies show that companies that are early adopters of digital technologies, including hashtag#GenAI, outperform their competitors. They gain efficiency, improve the customer experience, see faster revenue growth and thus gain a stronger competitive position. So, it's important to stay curious, follow industry trends and tech updates and experiment with them.On the other hand, it is also important to be pragmatic. Not everything that is new will work for us. But if you find something that works well, then you should implement it quickly.And it's not just about being the early bird; it's about leveraging the potential of GenAI to transform our business:👉Showing up: create transparency about solutions, tools and capabilities.👉Skilling up: Empower employees with the knowledge and skills to use GenAI tools effectively.👉Scaling up: Ensure that value is created for our core business.Especially the last aspect is important.So, let's catch that worm and scale it up together.hashtag#TogetherTalanxhashtag#Innovation",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7239195909941522433

Produktionsanlagen laufen oft rund um die Uhr und sind auf eine konstante Energieversorgung angewiesen. So können wir Sicherheit, Effizienz, Produktqualität und nicht zuletzt den Erhalt der Supply Chain gewährleisten. Die geplante Entgeltreform der Bundesnetzagentur zielt auf kurzfristige Verbrauchsänderungen ab. Sie ignoriert die technischen und wirtschaftlichen Realitäten unserer Branche, die sich über Jahre etabliert haben. Ein abruptes Anpassen des Stromverbrauchs würde nicht nur die Produktionsprozesse und Energieeffizienzmaßnahmen stören, denn eine flexible Anlagenfahrweise wirkt sich negativ auf die Energieeffizienz aus. Sie würde auch unsere Wettbewerbsfähigkeit gefährden, da eine Umstellung der Prozesse auf schwankende Energiezufuhr äußerst kostspielig und zeitaufwendig ist – es müssen Investitionen getätigt und Zielkonflikte aufgelöst werden. Die Vergrößerung von Produktlagern hätte darüber hinaus negative Auswirkungen auf das Working Capital und ist nur bedingt umsetzbar. Bei der Chloralkali-Elektrolyse, zum Beispiel, ist Chlor in großen Mengen kaum lagerbar und bedarf einer schnellen Weiterverarbeitung. Wie also können wir die Reform so gestalten, dass sie in der Praxis umsetzbar ist? Einige Vorschläge:▪ Langfristige Übergangsregelungen: Die Übergangsregelungen müssen über 2030 hinausgehen, um den betroffenen Unternehmen ausreichend Zeit zur Anpassung zu geben.▪ Praxistaugliche Entlastungsregelungen: Es sollten angemessene Toleranzschwellen und ausreichende Reaktionszeiten eingeführt werden, um eine realistische Umsetzung zu ermöglichen.▪ Berücksichtigung der Energiewendekompetenz: Die Entlastungsregelungen sollten nicht nur auf kurzfristige Verbrauchsänderungen fokussieren, sondern auch die langfristigen Beiträge der Unternehmen zur Energiewende würdigen. Wenn wir diese Punkte berücksichtigen, kann die Entgeltreform gelingen und wir können die dringend notwendige hashtag#Energiewende weiter vorantreiben – ohne dabei die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und hashtag#Transformation einer wichtigen Schlüsselbranche zu gefährden.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7237112927797829632

Die Dimension des erforderlichen Umbaus wird einem erst so richtig klar, wenn man sie aus verschiedenen Perspektiven jeden Tag wieder dargestellt bekommt. Zuversicht haben mir da aber die vielen kompetenten Kollegen gegeben.

Manas Human,2024-08-23 13:55:07,Text,post,post,210,5,0,"Just found an article I wrote around the year 2000! Some of the insights are bold, even for today. Excerpts below, 2+ decades old, comments in brackets are new.- Even though almost all large companies today have some sort of electronic ""backbone"" which carries at least all operational data, these companies are still far from being pictures of humming efficiency and continuous improvement.- All in all, there is a general under-performance in the formal workplace that disappoints first-time recruits within days of their joining. (!)- It is tedious to enter data, hence individuals choose not to enter it.- Where updates are to be change-triggered, it is often not obvious when the change takes place.... Many changes occur gradually, imperceptibly and continuously, frequently with a substantial ambiguity during the process. Information on these changes is never updated...- The mode of input of a lot of data and information is still the humble keyboard, which requires specially dedicated and considerable effort to transfer information from individual brains to the system.... At any time the information on the system is but a small subset of what is carried around by individuals in their brains.- There is the perception that light conjecture should not be permitted on the system... The system is not used so much for discussions as for posting results.- Hard data is not enough for managers. Research shows that managers strongly favour the verbal media and look for what is known as ""soft"" information... There is significant information content of a non-data kind in a face to face, or even a telephone, conversation. What is more, the human brain is of such construction that it finds this information content easy to latch on to. This information content is often referred to as ""soft"", although just because computers cannot process it does not mean it is in any way less significant than ""hard"" data. One is not a substitute for the other. Thus current... information systems, ERP packages for example, that focus on ""what information is needed where"" in a divide-and-conquer or command-and-control mode, serve only a limited purpose. No one is predicting that these systems will solve the majority of managerial problems. (!)- People are loathe to part with privileged information. The mere fact that information can be shared does not mean it will be shared.- The fact is that although basic operations are extremely vital to the success of a company, they are important not only in the sense that they must occur in an error-free way, but also in the sense that they need to be continuously improved and optimised. (!)(I love it all! It goes on to discuss how audio and video storage and processing  will develop, predicts the emergence of ""Omniscient Anonymous Manager"" systems that, paradoxically, should enable some free market dynamics in organisations instead of command and control ones.

Many of these are the very diseases we at Siemens Healthineers strive to combat through innovative technologies. Dr. Attia, as a physician, comes from a different angle. In ""Outlive,"" he emphasizes the significant impact that individual choices have on these conditions, including exercise, nutrition, sleep, and taking mental health seriously. The practical tips offered are as valuable as the theoretical insights.What struck me most was Dr. Attia’s self-critical journey towards a healthier lifestyle. He argues convincingly that modern medicine still sees itself too much as a ""break/fix,"" often waiting for an intervention to become necessary rather than focusing on prevention, coaching, and early detection. This perspective resonates deeply with our work at hashtag#SiemensHealthineers. We work every day on innovations and their global distribution to combat these diseases better, earlier, and more efficiently – but at the same time, ""Outlive"" highlights what is needed in conjunction with technology.To effectively address the challenges posed by workforce shortages, an increasing population, and the growing threat to public health from climate change, it is essential to consider both together: individual efforts for a healthier life and high-quality technologies for early prevention and treatment. This comprehensive approach will help manage the impact of these challenges.As you reflect on your health journey, consider this: How can you incorporate prevention into your daily life?

Dort stand ein Zitat von Hannah Arendt: „Wahrheit gibt es nur zu zweien.“Das Zitat sagt aus meiner Sicht zwei Dinge. Nämlich erstens, dass es wichtig ist, dass wir in den Dialog treten. Denn ansonsten führen wir letztlich Selbstgespräche und unsere „Wahrheiten“ werden zur Borniertheit.Zweitens sagt das Zitat aber auch, dass Wahrheit immer auch jemanden braucht, der sie einem „abkauft“. Wahrheit ist so betrachtet das, worauf man sich „einigt“. Und wir merken schon daran: Hier wird es kompliziert mit der „Wahrheit“. Denn sie existiert - als geteiltes Konstrukt betrachtet - ganz offensichtlich auch jenseits der Fakten und der Wirklichkeit (die wiederum ja immer nur durch die Filter unserer Wahrnehmung erlebt wird).Solche „geteilten Konstrukte“ geben Anlass zur Sorge. Denn wir sehen, dass sie sich oft von Fakten entfernen. Da kann ich sogar bei der Telekom bleiben. 5G macht Corona? Das wurde tatsächlich behauptet. Und wurde die Telekom-Gründung nicht 1994 beschlossen? Quersumme 23? Die Zahl der Illuminaten? So schnell habe ich mal eben eine Verschwörung aufgedeckt 😉Krude Thesen gab es immer.

During the session, I highlighted three crucial levers for the energy transition in India:1️⃣ Decarbonizing the industrial sector in India requires Gigawatt scale solutions. 2️⃣ A combination of blue and green pathways can accelerate carbon neutrality in hard-to-abate sectors.3️⃣ India has the potential to become a green ammonia powerhouse by tripling its capacity.This mindset is vital for industry leaders as we navigate and enable the energy transition. Following this, Sanmit Ahuja from hashtag#CETFi led a discussion on financing decarbonization, emphasizing the need for a host of first-of-a-kind (FOAK) projects that evolve into Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) portfolios. Furthermore, we explored India's hashtag#biomass availability and potential, discussing synergies with thyssenkrupp's biomass gasification technology, which holds immense promise for the country.  The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) provided valuable insights from a policy perspective, reiterating the necessity of a collaborative approach.

From the Place de la Concorde to the Eiffel Tower and along the Seine, Paris is a historic and beautiful setting in which to celebrate athletes from around the world and see them reunited with fans, friends, and family. Over 19 thrilling days, 10,500 world-class athletes from over 200 National Olympic and Paralympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team will compete across 32 different sports in the spirit of unity and peaceful competition.At hashtag#Allianz we are proud to be the Worldwide Olympic and Paralympic Insurance Partner. About 90 Team Allianz athletes will compete in Paris, cheered on by over 2,000 Allianz colleagues and supported by hundreds of Allianz volunteers who are working behind the scenes and on the ground to help ensure the Games’ success.The ingenuity and determination leading to this monumental event is inspiring, and I would like to highlight three areas that have earned my admiration:🥇 The athletes. Talent alone does not make an Olympian. The athletes are here in Paris because of their tireless training, optimism, and perseverance, often in the face of great adversity. 🥇 The democratic spirit of Paris 2024 is an inspiration to us all, with venues designed to encourage public accessibility and participation. For the first time in Olympic history, the Opening Ceremony will take place in the heart of a city, not in a remote stadium. The River Seine will be the public stage for welcoming the athletes. In an age of rising social polarization, the symbolism of these planning efforts is especially meaningful. 🥇 These Games have set a new standard for environmental progress. With a goal of halving carbon emissions compared to previous games, the Olympic Games Paris 2024 will be the first to align with the Paris Climate Agreement, showcasing environmental responsibility and encouraging sustainable practices that benefit us all, including, for example, the use of 100% renewable energy. Events that bring the world together, like hashtag#Paris2024, are made possible through strong public-private partnerships. At Allianz, we believe in the power of sports to elevate and unite, and to transcend social and cultural barriers, which is why we’ve been the Worldwide Insurance Partner of the Olympic and Paralympic Movements since 2021. Through our partnership, we manage risks, provide protection for events, organizers, participants and spectators, and support athletes through mentoring and career opportunities. We also mobilize health initiatives to help the next generation stay active. Allianz’s history in supporting the Olympics dates back to 1972 and we became the official Olympics and Paralympic partner in 2021. A special thank you to my Allianz colleagues whose work over many months has helped to enable this momentous, unifying event. Let the Games begin!International Olympic Committee – IOC International Paralympic Committee",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7222513072496664578

Meine 2 Cents aus Industrieperspektive:Die potenziell bevorstehende Aufteilung Deutschlands in mehrere Stromgebotszonen ist ein kontroverses Thema. Auf den ersten Blick mag ein Split sinnvoll erscheinen, hauptsächlich, weil er strukturellen Engpässen entgegenwirkten soll. Bei genauerem Hinsehen ergeben sich jedoch einige Nachteile, z.B.:- Für bestehende Industriestandorte, die sich nicht einfach verlagern können, würde eine Gebotszonenteilung einen unkalkulierbaren Wettbewerbsnachteil bedeuten. Planungs- und Genehmigungshürden machen Standortverlagerungen langwierig und oft unmöglich.- Es besteht das Risiko, dass der Ansatz dezentraler Preiszonen den dringend benötigten Netzausbau weiter verzögert.- Investitionsanreize für erneuerbare Energien im Süden würden durch Preisunterschiede konterkariert. Der Ausbau ließe sich nur noch mit massiver staatlicher Förderung finanzieren.- Der Strommarkt würde durch eine Aufteilung in Gebotszonen deutlich an Liquidität verlieren, da gesicherte Lieferungen nur noch regional möglich wären.- Studien zeigen: Die Gebotszonenteilung verringert zwar Eingriffe der Übertragungsnetzbetreiber, beseitigt die Netzengpässe aber keineswegs. Der dringend nötige Netzausbau bleibt unerlässlich.- Die Einführung von Gebotszonen würde enorme Bürokratie und Unsicherheit für Netzbetreiber, Marktteilnehmer, Industrie und Behörden bedeuten – in einer ohnehin sensiblen Transformationsphase.- Ein Gebotszonensplit könnte zudem das im Grundgesetz und auch im aktuellen Koalitionsvertrag verankerte Prinzip gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse in Deutschland gefährden.Ganzheitlich betrachtet, erscheint eine einheitliche bundesweite Gebotszone mit liquiden Strommärkten, Investitionssicherheit und Wettbewerbsgleichheit der deutlich bessere Weg. Der konsequente Ausbau der Übertragungsnetze zur Beseitigung der Engpässe muss dabei oberste Priorität haben.Mehr dazu in der Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (Link in den Kommentaren).

Yesterday, alongside Kristian Ruby, I attended the Informal Energy Council to outline Eurelectric’s Grids for Speed study and what we need to supercharge Europe’s grid growth.  You know the numbers by now: Europe needs to almost double its annual investments in distribution grids to 67bn EUR a year between now and 2050 – this can be reduced to 55bn EUR a year if we pull the right levers. Why? Because speed is of the essence. Take E.ON: it took almost 15 years for 1 million RES plants to feed into our networks, it will take only 3 years to connect the second million.  The other part of the equation is turning electrification in Europe into hyperdrive. Over the past decade the rate has stagnated, a little over 20% and that’s not good enough: we need to speed up the electrification of Europe’s society and economy by a factor of 4 between now and 2050.  I was impressed to see a strong commitment by EU countries to deliver RePowerEU goals by 2030 and the central role of electricity in the quest for energy autonomy.  And one final message: whilst electricity will fuel our economy, we have to fuel electricity with capital. Our energy costs are shifting and we have to make a big down payment in the next decade to invest in heat pumps, EVs, RES and grid infrastructure.

In our fast-paced world, people feel sometimes overwhelmed and exhausted rather than eager to take on new challenges.Recent studies show that our perception of challenges in work and private life has a significant impact on how we experience them. People with a balanced growth mindset see them as opportunities to learn and grow, leading to less exhaustion and better overall wellbeing. So, it’s about mindset and the skill to balance work and private life in a way that we profit in a fulfilling and healthy way.In my opinion, ""Work hard, play hard"" in the sense of a balanced growth mindset and hashtag#mindfulness are important to improve the quality of life. 👉 Hard work teaches us valuable lessons and thus promotes personal growth. The satisfaction that comes from achieving hard-earned goals is unrivalled.👉 Purposeful work gives us even more satisfaction and can make us feel proud. At Talanx Group, for example, our purpose is: ""Together we take care of the unexpected and foster entrepreneurship"". With our hard work, we are there for our customers at the moment of truth.👉 Play hard in the form of hobbies, sports, social engagement and spending quality time with family and friends can balance our energy level. With a balanced growth mindset, we can lead an intense, fulfilling, and healthy life.Let's make every moment count! What do you think about this topic?

We need to drive the single market forward for Europe to keep any relevance in the world of tomorrow.

Exactly what Enrico Letta is asking for in his report and I was pleased that he joined our E.ON event to make his case again.  But Europe needs to do more. It needs to focus and prioritize. Get a few important things done as those suggested in the Letta report. And refrain from doing everything in parallel. We can’t cope with another avalanche of new EU regulation and stay competitive. We need to have a political strategy. Ann Mettler was impressive in making this request.  Clearly pleasing every NGO on every topic and dying in bureaucracy is not the solution.

Their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion resonates deeply with our mission to foster an open, fair, and pluralistic society not just during hashtag#PrideMonth, but year-round.Katie Marseilles, UNITE Lead U.S., Covestro LLC (t.l.)""True workplace inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community requires ongoing education, inclusive language and policies, visible allyship, and an environment where LGBTQ+ employees can be their authentic selves without fear. It is on all of us - through actions like attending trainings, joining ERGs (employee resource groups) like UNITE, advocating for equal benefits, calling out discrimination, mentoring LGBTQ+ colleagues, and proudly celebrating identities - to create an equitable culture of belonging."" Ron Debiec, UNITE Lead U.S., Covestro LLC (t.r.)""True LGBTQ+ equity begins with active allyship and LGBTQ+ visibility. Let others know you are inclusive by sharing your pronouns and using gender neutral language. Use trainings and ERG resources to learn about LGBTQ+ history, experiences, and statistics so you can relate to your LGBTQ+ friends, family, and colleagues. If you’re openly LGBTQ+, embrace your identity and be a guide for those who are not quite ready to do so. The more we do to value and respect the LGBTQ+ community, the more inclusive and equitable our spaces become for everyone.""

Always be vigilant and fight together to the end.👉 To learn from mistakes and losses – these learnings will lead you to your legacy. 👉 To play together as a star team and not as a team of stars.I cannot emphasise enough how important the ""togetherness"" factor is in this context.

These advancements regarding hydrogen infrastructure allow for the replacement of fossil resources in production processes, fostering sustainability in traditional industries.

Accurately recording ESG metrics has become key to improving both the top and the bottom line and winning and retaining customers, employees, and investors.  But as new and updated regional and national regulations are introduced, businesses must continuously adapt if they want to remain compliant. In the coming weeks, for example, EU member states are required to reflect the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive in their national regulations to help standardize sustainability reporting. And later this year, the Regulation on Deforestation-free products will require transparency and traceability across global supply chains to guarantee the products EU citizens consume do not contribute to deforestation worldwide. Meeting these obligations requires a reliable foundation for ESG data management and reporting to help collect, share, and integrate ESG data both within individual companies and across supply chains.

This week, I visited our customers and our claims teams in Nordendorf, one of several towns in Germany recovering from recent floods that have devastated homes, small businesses, and personal property across the region.Natural catastrophes like floods inflict profound physical damage, but also a special kind of trauma, displacing people from their homes, upending their lives and disrupting their livelihoods. I met with our customers affected by the deluge, and I could see the effects of loss through their eyes ­ not only in their perspective, but also in the fatigue that was evident in their expressions.I also spent time with the claims teams who have been working around the clock to support our customers with compassion, speed, and impact. We met in a mobile operations center provided by Allianz France.Journalists from the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung have accompanied our Allianz colleague Andreas Stoye and captured how our people help our customers in the moments that matter: https://lnkd.in/dfjEu5FqI observed an impressive community spirit and collective strength in the face of adversity. In addition to our business and human outreach, Allianz has donated one million euros to local fire departments, rescue organizations and technical relief services, in addition to doubling employee donations up to €500,000, which will be directed to the Red Cross. This contribution underscores our belief in the importance of public-private cooperation to tackle societal issues, which are felt at the individual level, but can only be solved with a macro approach.Insurers like Allianz are evolving their business models to address climate risk. As a global insurer operating in over 70 markets, Allianz is on the front lines of helping people and businesses prepare for, recover from, and adapt to increasingly extreme weather events caused by climate change. The EU suffered more than €50bn in economic losses from natural catastrophes in both 2021 and 2022, according to EIOPA data. That was more than three times the annual average in the previous decade.Our risk knowhow and advanced data-driven technology serve our customers on both the local and macro level, because we do more than pay our claims after disaster strikes. Our customers value the fact that we can predict climate risks and support resilience measures, including by partnering with local and national authorities to promote smart infrastructure planning that can reduce physical damage and prevent loss of life.I thank our customers for continuing to place your trust in Allianz and for partnering with us.

By using it, fossil resources become superfluous, making traditional processes more sustainable. As pioneers, we at thyssenkrupp aim to shape the national and international hydrogen economy and pave the way for a hashtag#greentransformation. Teamwork is essential here, involving politics, the financial sector, science, and business. This requires active exchange, such as at the Handelsblatt Wasserstoffgipfel in Essen and the Financial Times Hydrogen Summit in London. Our ambition goes beyond decarbonizing our own operations. We aim to enable our customers to achieve their climate targets with our innovative, green solutions. To this end, we have consolidated our expertise in our hashtag#DecarbonTechnologies segment. For the industrial-scale production of green hydrogen, electrolysers like those from thyssenkrupp nucera are essential, along with the accelerated expansion of renewable energies. The slewing bearings from thyssenkrupp rothe erde play a decisive role here. Moreover, it is clear that hydrogen will primarily be produced where green electricity is affordable, such as in South Africa, Australia, Chile, Iberian Peninsula, and the MENA region. Ammonia is needed as a transport medium to deliver hydrogen to where it is required. thyssenkrupp Uhde is a global technology leader in ammonia cracking and the construction of plants for green ammonia. One of the future uses of green hydrogen will be in the direct reduction plant at thyssenkrupp Steel in Duisburg to produce green steel. By operating purely with hydrogen, we can save up to 3.5 million tons of CO2, while simultaneously accelerating the hydrogen ramp-up with our substantial demand. This effort is significant for North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, and Europe.

Diese Sorge teile ich.Extreme Parteien schaden unserer #Demokratie, unserer Gesellschaft und unserer Wirtschaft. Sie schwächen das Gemeinschaftsprojekt Europa. Vernünftige Kompromisse auszuloten und zu schließen dürfte zukünftig noch schwerer werden. Die Wahlergebnisse sind ein deutliches Zeichen dafür, dass die politischen Angebote demokratischer Parteien einen wachsenden Teil der Bevölkerung nicht mehr erreichen. Die Ursachen dafür mögen vielfältig sein. Mich persönlich beunruhigt dabei vor allem, dass so viele junge Menschen den Lockrufen der Populisten erlegen sind. Wie können wir also damit umgehen?Positiv stimmt mich, dass die Wahlbeteiligung einen Rekordwert erreicht hat. Das zeigt, dass immer mehr Menschen die Bedeutung von #Europa verstanden haben und ihre Stimme in die politische Debatte einbringen wollen. Darauf müssen wir alle aufbauen. Und zwar mit einem klaren Fokus auf Fakten statt Ideologien und Wachstumsimpulsen statt Bürokratie.

Milton Friedmans Diktum „The business of business is business“ möchte ich ergänzen: „The business of business is business WITH PURPOSE“. Denn es kann nicht nur um den Profit gehen. Es geht auch darum, Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Deshalb habe ich heute im Town Hall mit den Mitarbeitenden der Telekom das Thema Nachhaltigkeit in den Mittelpunkt gerückt.Nachhaltigkeit ist nicht nur ein Buzzword. Die aktuelle Hochwasserlage zeigt, wie wichtig es ist, Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Deshalb bringen wir als Unternehmen die Dimensionen der Nachhaltigkeit in die Balance: ökonomische, ökologische und gesellschaftliche Verantwortung.Dimension Ökonomie: Ökonomisch stehen wir gut da. Zum Beispiel sind wir in allen Märkten, in denen die Telekom agiert, die Nummer 1 bei den Netzen. Wir haben Kunden dazugewonnen und wachsen stärker als der Wettbewerb. Aber abseits der Unternehmenszahlen bewegen wir uns in einem Umfeld, das uns alle angeht: Wir handeln als Unternehmen in Umwelt und Gesellschaft.Dimension Ökologie: Wir haben wir uns ehrgeizige Ziele gesetzt und bereits viel erreicht, denn die Telekom übernimmt Verantwortung für die Umwelt. Zum Beispiel beziehen wir bereits 100 Prozent unserer Energie aus erneuerbaren Quellen, um die CO2-Emissionen weiter zu reduzieren – bis 2040 wollen wir bei Netto-Null sein. Und der Anteil an nachhaltigen Produkten steigt kontinuierlich an.Dimension Gesellschaft: Die Telekom nimmt auch ihre soziale Verantwortung wahr. Wir bieten z.B. spezielle Tarife für benachteiligte Bevölkerungsgruppen an. Und setzen uns aktiv gegen Hass und Hetze im Netz ein. Die Telekom fördert die Vielfalt in der Belegschaft genauso wie die Inklusion von Menschen mit Behinderungen. Ein Beispiel dafür ist unsere Beteiligung an den Special Olympics und die Bereitstellung von Informationen in leichter Sprache.Dimension Europa: Nachhaltigkeit braucht aber auch den richtigen Rahmen. Und dieser Rahmen ist für uns Europa. Denn Europa teilt die Werte, für die wir auch als Telekom einstehen: Gegen Diskriminierung, gegen Hass und Hetze, aber für Vielfalt und für sozialen Verantwortung. Wir können alle etwas tun. Und es gibt dieses Wochenende direkt einen Anlass: Die Europawahlen stehen bevor. Deshalb habe ich an die Mitarbeitenden appelliert und tue es auch hier: Gehen Sie wählen!Michael Hagspihl #nachhaltigkeit #esg #europa",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7204839186338590720

Dazu habe ich gestern auf dem #BDEW-Kongress mit Bundesaußenministerin Annalena Baerbock diskutiert. Mir war es dabei wichtig, die Bundesregierung und die Bundesministerin in die Pflicht zu nehmen. Wir müssen Außen-, Wirtschafts-, Energie und Handelspolitik zusammendenken und konsequent handeln! Hier drei Baustellen aus meiner Sicht:   1. Klimadiplomatie: Ziel muss ein globaler Rahmen sein, in dem Marktmechanismen – nicht national ausgerichtete Planwirtschaft – zur Klimaneutralität führen. Alles andere dauert zu lange und wird viel zu teuer, weil Skaleneffekte nicht realisierbar sind. Es ist Europas Aufgabe, darauf hinzuwirken und dieses dicke Brett zu bohren. Andernfalls wird die Klimapolitik Europas scheitern. 2. Energiepartnerschaften als starke Antwort auf geopolitische Risiken verankern! Über Energiepartnerschaften wird viel geredet, aber in der europäischen Gesamtschau sind sie noch längst nicht stabil genug, um eine Investitionsbasis zu bilden – und das gilt vor allem aus einer deutschen Perspektive. 3. Anstatt vieler Einzeldiskussionen müssen wir stärker an einheitlichen Lösungen arbeiten. Die energiepolitische Landschaft Europas gleicht noch immer einem Flickenteppich. Das neue Marktdesign beinhaltet in der Theorie viele gute Ansätze, die es nun in die Praxis zu überführen und zu spezifizieren gilt. Aber die Wahrheit ist auch: Es sind im Großen und Ganzen gemeinsame Regeln für die nationalen Energiemärkte, von einem integrierten europäischen Binnenmarkt sind wir noch weit entfernt. Drei Baustellen, und an der Stelle darf es nicht aufhören.

Especially in the face of a VUCA world, disrupting ourselves at both an individual and organisational level is the key to outperform our peers. Here are some learnings from years of disrupting myself:👉 Question the status-quo. 👉 Don’t get addicted to be right. Think pragmatically and see your ideas as an experiment. Changing your mind is a moment of growth.👉 Cultivate a diverse network and ask for advice. Consult your critics, too! Yes, it means to be vulnerable. But their input will propel you forward. 👉 Step out of your comfort zone. Stay curious, engage with new opportunities to learn, and grow. 👉 Don’t be afraid to fail. Success comes with failure when you learn from your mistakes. 👉 As a leader, foster curiosity, learning and collaboration in your teams. Promote a growth mindset.Last but not least: We need trust for this to happen! Do you have tips on how to disrupt oneself?

The app also makes it easier to settle accounts with friends. The payzy wallet is easy to top up by EC card, credit card or SEPA transfer.

We are at 36 and need to get to 67bn annually in capital deployment. If it sounds daunting, think of it as a downpayment for our energy security. You may also be surprised to know it’s in the same ballpark as road 64bn EUR/year and rail investment volumes 49bn EUR/year.  But bullish investment figures are not the whole story. We took a long, hard look at how we can lower the costs and ensure they can be bearable for consumers. If we pull all available levers, we can save 12bn EUR annually. By strategically upsizing our assets – what we call anticipatory investments – we can save 7bn/year. Another 5bn/year can be shaved off if we tap into grid-friendly flexibility, meaning not synchronising consumers to create peaks. And another 1bn/year can be saved by increasing the performance of the assets.  To get this done, we first need lots of low-cost capital to flow our way and so DSOs need to offer attractive returns to investors. We rely on political leaders, regulators and financial actors to be our partners here.  Thank you to Eurelectric, EY and all colleagues involved in a Grids for Speed study done well in record time.

Dinge fallen uns vor allem dann ins Auge, wenn sie richtig schieflaufen. Zum Beispiel, wenn Kunststoffe als Müll in der Umwelt enden. Diesen Problemen müssen wir uns gemeinsam stellen. Die Chemie- und Kunststoffindustrie tut das seit Jahren. Wir denken Kunststoffe neu, halten sie so lange wie möglich im Kreislauf, entwickeln Recyclingtechnologien und setzen alternative Rohstoffe in der Produktion ein. Ganz wichtig: Die Produkte von Anfang an so konzipieren, dass sie lange halten, gut reparierbar sind und am Ende einfach recycelt werden können. Die Transformation der Kunststoffe und der dahinterliegenden Wertschöpfungsketten (Rohstoffe, Produktion, Konsum, Entsorgungswirtschaft) hin zur #Kreislaufwirtschaft muss unser Fokus sein. Und sie braucht jetzt den Rückenwind von Politik und Gesellschaft. Denn nur dann wird sie uns gelingen, und Kunststoffe können ihrer essenziellen Rolle in unser aller nachhaltigen Zukunft gerecht werden. Mehr zu meiner Position in meinem Interview mit der Frankfurter Rundschau: https://lnkd.in/eiaFN2VH#Recycling #FullyCircular",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7198699988338524163

In our daily lives, particularly at the workplace, we can counter this trend by establishing habits of understanding that embrace diversity and inclusion. At Allianz, cultivating workforce diversity is a long-term investment in strengthening our organization, futureproofing it for demographic and societal shifts, and ensuring our continued resilience around the globe. A culture of inclusion and belonging enriches our organization with perspectives, experiences, and talents, enhancing innovation, problem-solving and competitiveness. Our approach values unity, authenticity and compassion and spans gender, generation, nationalities/ethnicities, disability, and LGBTQ. The work is ongoing, but we take pride in our progress, including being recognized by Great Place to Work certifications across 43 units in 26 countries in 2023.Now is no time to rest or resist progress. By 2025, millennials will comprise 75% of the global workforce. According to Deloitte research, this generation has a unique perspective on diversity. While older generations tend to view diversity through the lenses of race, demographics, equality and representation, millennials see diversity as a melding of varying experiences, backgrounds, and viewpoints. They view the ideal workplace as a supportive environment that honors varying perspectives on a given issue.

For a detailed breakdown of the numbers, see the post of our CFO Maria Ferraro: https://lnkd.in/dUw4M8dV Notably, we are observing an increase in electricity market demand, attributed to ongoing economic recovery and the growing electrification of the energy supply. The growth in data and computer centers, for example, is fueling a global surge in electricity demand, which is consequently driving demand for our products and services. Regarding our wind business, we have initiated turnaround measures and steps for long-term strategic development with the aim of achieving a double-digit operating margin.

But then, there will be substance! At the “Bankentag”, a summit of the Bundesverband deutscher Banken, I outlined what I think is important in the current phase: - Fewer laws:More laws do not immediately create more legal certainty. It is difficult for legislation to anticipate what will happen in the area of artificial intelligence. Rather, companies need the freedom to experiment with AI. We use data to improve. It's hard to live with scissors in our heads when all we're concerned about is whether we're allowed to do something or not, while our competitors use all this data to optimize their services. However, that doesn't mean that there are no rules needed at all. - Equal opportunities:Large language models arise where there is data. And they are in the cloud. America and Asia currently have a location advantage. Also because of higher energy costs in Europe. Nevertheless, we want our own solutions. Telekom relies on partners. For example, we cooperate with SingTel and SK Telekom. And we create specific language models. - Try more:As Telekom, we are already using AI. In over 400 projects. And our employees get AI training. Because every area can use artificial intelligence. To offer our customers innovative products to become more productive and faster.

I could not agree more. And I take this as a compliment for our work done so far in the past, although I also emphasize once again how important further expansion is. Now we need to grow and digitalise our critical infrastructure to gear up for a more electrified, thus more autonomous and stronger Energy Union, because as recently emphasized by the Commission in taking stock of the fruitful Clean Transition Dialogues, “a modern network infrastructure is the backbone for industry”. Last week I wrote to all 27 EU Energy Ministers calling on them to empower Europe’s electricity grids in particular at distribution level. We know we have a historical investment task ahead of us, but we also have to acknowledge that non-investment comes with its own steep price tag.  As we pointed out in the recent Energy Infrastructure report by ERT, it is fundamental that the next EU legislature and industry leaders lock arms in efforts to fast-track European grid development and foster a regulatory environment that supports both our Green Deal ambitions as well as the growth of European companies.

That is according to the Global Wind Report 2024, which was published today by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). The report sets out a clear path for hashtag#action – among the key takeaways are the need to: 🔹 Mobilize larger volumes of investment into wind energy. 🔹 Collaborate to build a secure global supply chain with healthy, managed competition. 🔹 Close the gap on grids. 🔹 Promote a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce to enable our industry to deliver a just transition.  At Siemens Gamesa, and through our GWEC membership as part of Siemens Energy, we will continue to closely cooperate with our partners in the wind industry – and with policymakers in Europe and across the world.

The partnership is also foundational to Allianz’ business.The pursuit of trust and understanding, particularly when it comes to protecting freedom and democracy, are core values of Allianz. That is why we have underwritten a survey examining the state of trust in the US-German partnership. Jointly commissioned by Allianz, Atlantik-Brücke e.V. and the American Council on Germany and conducted by Edelman DXI, this survey research initiated in May 2022. This year’s results are a sobering wake-up call. Public trust in the German-American relationship is lower today than it was two years ago, driven by mutually shared concerns about a growing lack of society’s willingness and skill to reach compromise and consensus. People on both sides of the Atlantic are concerned about the rise of extremism and are discouraged by issues that threaten socio-economic stability. These findings are disheartening but not surprising. People are skeptical when misinformation degrades truth & accountability. People are frustrated with a lack of compromise & consensus domestically and globally. They are tired of seeing leaders that put ideology before pragmatic solutions, even as they work harder than ever to make ends meet & yet still seem to be ill-prepared for an uncertain future. The purpose of this survey is not to add to a cycle of gloom but to listen and learn. Gaining data-driven insight into the perceptions and expectations of Americans & Germans helps all avoid taking the relationship for granted and stay alert to risks that weaken the bonds between us. The report’s findings show that business has the responsibility, & the mandate, to strengthen the ties connecting our countries as two of the world’s largest, most vibrant economies and trading partners. Businesses & governments must join forces to inspire people with reasons to believe that democracies deliver, to underscore the privileges that free & open societies like ours offer, & to demonstrate that co-operation is the basis for tackling the common issues we face.Through co-operation, we have the power to reconcile differences and regain trust. I invite my fellow business leaders at companies with operations, trade, investments, & friendships across the US & Germany to respond to the high expectations people have for our business. Let us capture the opportunity to demonstrate what compromise, consensus, & collaborative public/private action can look like, for the sake of global security & our German & American employees, customers, partners, shareholders & friends. https://lnkd.in/eppYzJp6",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7185935394503368705

It’s a widespread challenge that impacts individuals, small businesses, and corporates alike, putting all stakeholders at risk, consumers to investors. In today’s digitally interconnected world, cyber security demands active management.  The year 2023 saw an unprecedented surge in cyber-attacks and IT outages, resulting in record losses, mainly due to ransomware and extortion. With these threats rising in frequency, sophistication, and severity, it is no surprise that the Allianz Risk Barometer 2024 report identified cyber security as the top global business risk. Key concerns among respondents include data breaches (59%), and attacks on critical infrastructure and physical assets (53%), often resulting in business interruption or liability issues and impacting an organization’s financial performance.  As cyberattacks become more sophisticated, individuals are also becoming more vulnerable to various consequences such as financial loss, identity theft, emotional distress, and damage to their reputations. What often goes unnoticed are the mental health costs associated with these data breaches. According to the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer, globally, nearly 73% express worry about data privacy, and over 70% are concerned about cybersecurity.  While it’s essential for individuals to improve their security awareness, organizations must also foster a cyber security conscious culture to maintain the trust of their stakeholders. The insurance industry plays a vital role in improving overall cyber resilience. Insurers can help transfer risk and promote efforts to mitigate risks. Insurers are at the forefront of cyber security, continuously assessing and adapting risks factors, such as the quality of digital skills, innovative solutions, and collaborative partnerships. At Allianz, we’re constantly enhancing our technical expertise and leveraging technologies like AI to predict threats and assess risks. Our efforts go beyond addressing losses and actively prioritize prevention, preparedness, and risk education. While Cyber Insurance doesn’t replace strong cyber risk management, when combined, it strengthens customers against cyber-attacks. Our industry-leading partnerships further reinforce our comprehensive cyber security and cyber care protections. Additionally, our Cyber Centre of Competence ensures coordinated support globally, offering tailored solutions such as data breach liability coverage, network security protection, and crisis management.  The insurance industry has always risen to meet the challenge of emerging and evolving risks. Cyber is no exception. Insurers like Allianz are essential partners in navigating the evolving risk landscape with resilience and confidence.  #Cybersecurity #Cyberrisk #Securityawareness #Allianz",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7183719401416712192

Als große Organisation finden wir von der Hochtemperatur-Wärmepumpe bis zu PV und Pelletkessel genau die Lösungen, die passen.

Zum Know-how gehört heute, sich in großen Netzwerken mit Kunden, Partnern und Behörden zu bewegen und hierin zu überzeugen, auf innovative Technologien zu setzen. Dafür muss man die Kopplung der Sektoren Strom und Wärme genauso verstehen wie Gesetze und Förderkulissen. Denn wir stehen am Ende gegenüber unseren Kunden dafür gerade, dass die Investitionen wirtschaftlich und die CO2-Emissionen raus sind. Die Wärmewende kann ein Modernisierungsprogramm für die deutsche Wirtschaft sein. Wir müssen es aber auch gemeinsam finanzieren können.

Smart work would unlock my full potential. No doubt, working smart is truly a smart idea.But for me, the real game changer is: The synergy of hard work and smart work. There are three main reasons why this powerful combination leads to high performance:👉Effective achievement of strategic goals: Hard work helps you set ambitious goals, and smart work helps you breaking them down to manageable tasks and setting up a structured schedule that transforms aspirations into reality.👉Higher efficiency: Hard work provides dedication, while smart work ensures you're optimizing your efforts. 👉Greater innovative power: Hard work involves putting in the hours to master your craft. Smart work fosters innovation and adaptability to change.Apart from hard work and smart work, there are two more crucial secrets to high performance: The people you work with and the culture within the organisation.

Various factors contribute to these fears: war, political unrest, economic volatility, climate change, natural catastrophes, demographic shifts, and the unknown implications of technological advancements. All this undermines trust in institutions and is challenging people’s sense of a common purpose built on shared values.  We stand at a critical crossroads, particularly in a year when elections will be held in 64 countries, representing about half of the world’s population. This disconnect creates a dangerous environment for those leaders who thrive on easy promises and ‘us versus them’ divisions. At Allianz, we understand that we have a leading role to play in these challenging times – as an economic ‘shock absorber’ and ‘social stabilizer’, but also as a bridge builder. Our employee-led network, GRACE (Global Race and Cultural Ethnicity Network), reflects our commitment to creating an inclusive and discrimination-free workplace. It offers a platform for sharing insights and fostering a workplace where diversity is celebrated and everyone is welcome, regardless of cultural ethnicity, nationality, gender, or age. We take pride in our diverse workforce, which includes individuals from 176 nationalities, with 5 nationalities represented on our SE Board. Nevertheless, advancing inclusivity isn’t something we can tackle alone; it requires collaboration across all sectors of society. Collaboration among the public and private sectors, civil society, and all generations. This joint effort is crucial for championing diversity and inclusion while fighting against racism. The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination serves as an important reminder of our commitment to this cause. Every day, individuals face racist remarks, attitudes, and prejudices. We must stand up against racism every single day of the year, denying its presence in society – addressing not only in obvious situations but also instances of conscious or unconscious bias that lead to racist behavior. We believe that rooting discrimination and extremism is not just a moral obligation but also a business imperative. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion aren’t just superficial checkboxes; they are deeply embedded into our ethos and business strategy. DEI serves as the driving engine behind employee engagement, customer satisfaction, and stakeholder confidence. Trust guides our actions, inclusion shapes our principles. By effectively mitigating risk, Allianz doesn’t just help people navigate uncertainty; we empower them to thrive in it. Through our business initiatives, we have the opportunity to strengthen our social fabric by supporting individuals and communities in building a brighter, shared future. Together, we must stand up against polarization and overcome the fears standing in the way of progress toward free and open societies.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7176514244576739329

For the first time, more post-consumer plastic waste is being recycled (26.9%) than put in landfill (23.5%)2. Post-consumer recycled content in new products increased by 70% since 2018 while the proportion of plastics from bio-based feedstock in converted plastics remains low (0.9%)3. The demand for recycled plastics content can be increased through appropriate policy measures and investments in e.g., different recycling technologies4. The growing competitiveness gap between Europe and the rest of the world could hinder the region's ability to invest in and lead on circularity initiatives as Europe may become increasingly dependent on imports which do not necessarily meet EU sustainability standards5. A circular economy for plastics can only be achieved through close collaboration between all actors within the European polymer value chain, including policymakers and regulators (this one is not new but cannot be emphasized often enough) So, we're seeing continuous progress towards a #CircularEconomy for plastics in Europe, but we need all hands on deck to accelerate this transition.

At the same time, as highlighted in our annual report, we navigated our business and managed our capital position effectively, to ensure exceptional performance for all our stakeholders.  Likewise, the actions outlined in our sustainability reporting demonstrate our ability to work on even the most daunting global challenges, particularly the environment. Climate change’s impact on individuals and businesses is profound: it threatens people’s incomes, homes, and health. It puts companies’ physical assets and business continuity at risk. A highlight of our work is the net-zero transition plan, published in 2023. The plan details our long-term strategic climate commitment to achieve net-zero emissions in insurance, proprietary investments and own operations and outlines intermediate targets by 2030. The plan is based on science and in line with the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C.  A big thank you to all involved in developing these two reports, as well as to our employees and partners for their daily contributions towards shaping a more stable, resilient and sustainable world – for our customers and for society as a whole.  Learn more here: https://lnkd.in/dQX-E4gN #Sustainability #NetZero #ClimateAction #ClimateChange #AllianzOnClimate #Allianz",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7173022322973392897

The premise is a simple geological reality: we do not sit on abundant energy reserves as other geographies do. I was pleased to discuss these issues with Commissioner @Vestager Wednesday in Brussels, alongside my fellow @Eurelectric Presidency team @MarkusRauramo and @GiorgiosStassis.The financeability of homegrown electricity is crucial. We must unlock the means to deliver the necessary investments in our transition by putting today’s idle capital to work. Completing the Capital Market Union is a must to provide new and wider choices of funding at lower costs. We also need to adopt the right de-risking tools, such as Capacity Markets that are open to all technologies that can make power supply more reliable.This can all work within the framework of the internal electricity market and with the right sized electricity infrastructure. Deepening the unity, efficiency and interconnectedness between EU countries should remain a top priority.  This also means the 25% bureaucracy reduction target is not aspirational, it’s a necessity. So, now before elections, it’s a good time to call on the next legislature to reflect about its raison d’être.

Christian Bruch,2024-03-08 08:30:17,Text + Video,post,post,747,9,16,"Today is International Women's Day. A day where I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight an issue very important to me through two stories from our Team Purple at Siemens Energy. The first comes from Sophie Ash who takes care of the operations of one of our offshore wind projects in North Wales. She faced a problem many women face in the industry, namely that when she started, there was no immersion suit small enough to fit her – a suit that is required in emergencies for our colleagues who work out on tumultuous seas. This comes down to the fact that a lot of Personal Protective Equipment – or PPE for short – is modeled on the standard male height and size and simply does not fit where it needs to for many women. Subsequently, Sophie became the driving force behind the creation of a working group that looked into bringing more diversity into our industry and ensuring that irrespective of gender, shape, or size, every employee has access to the correct PPE that will keep them safe at work. The second story comes from Taiana Rodrigues in Brazil. She found that the welding bench she was using was uncomfortably high and therefore impacting her work. This observation sparked a collaborative effort, leading to an adjustable welding device every employee can set to match their height. See the short clip below. These stories – just two of many – showcase that no matter if we are talking about industrial tools, machinery, or PPE, one size does not fit all. Creating awareness for inclusive PPE also creates awareness of the need for more women in the energy industry. As we simply cannot afford to lose anyone, regardless of gender, who can help bring about the energy transition. There is still a lot that needs to happen, but it starts with people like Sophie and Taiana, who challenge the status quo and pave the way for more inclusivity and diversity in our workplace.#IWD2024 #diversity #inclusion",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7171784279620890625

Sophie Ash and Matt Scaum, colleagues of mine at Siemens Gamesa, have addressed this issue head-on.  While completing an offshore training, Sophie discovered that personal protective equipment (PPE) is generally only available in larger sizes. Sizes that would typically be suitable for men. When looking at the photo of Sophie standing alongside our colleague Gareth Brandrick, it’s clear that PPE is not a one size fits all. Determined to address the lack of suitable PPE, especially for women, Sophie approached Matt, her procurement colleague. And together they raised the issue with our PPE providers. As a result of their initiative, a dozen of providers committed to inclusivity. In addition, we’ve amended our contracts to ensure that at least two of the smallest and largest sizes of PPE will be available at trainings. These are important steps in the right direction. And we are grateful for Sophie’s and Matt’s valuable contributions to inclusivity and gender equity.

But it represents more than just a date on the calendar or a trending hashtag. It’s a call to action that reminds us to consider the importance, and the benefits, of gender balance and equality every day of the year. Although we’ve seen great progress, persistent challenges faced by women worldwide require our ongoing attention.  An upcoming Allianz research report will aim to shine a light on these issues. This comprehensive study will cover 37 countries and examine the well-being of women across various areas such as life and health, education and skills, labor and financial inclusion, participation in decision-making, and retirement security. While women have made significant progress in education and political representation, there is more opportunity for progressing in achieving equal pay for equal work, safeguarding health, and promoting female labor participation.  The soon-to-be released study also highlights a decrease in governance-related official development assistance (ODA) that has historically served as a crucial lifeline for women’s rights organizations and movements. Financial backing for such initiatives ensures sustained progress towards helping women, and all people, reach their full potential. Allianz has a long history of championing the leadership of women in our company, not only globally, but around the world.

Instead, the raw materials we use, particularly fossil fuels like crude oil, have the most substantial impact. These so-called #Scope3_emissions present us with complex challenges – from the definition of realistic reduction targets to the detailed planning and implementation of specific measures. The complexity stems from the inherent uncertainties and inter dependencies, which necessitate numerous assumptions: What will recycling rates look like in the future? What quantity of bio-based raw materials will be available at what time? To effectively reduce Scope 3 emissions, we need a clear vision, commitment, and a willingness to rethink existing processes across the entire value chain. This endeavor demands close cooperation with our suppliers and customers, as our ultimate goal is to make the entire value chain more sustainable. At Covestro, we understand that achieving climate targets is not a brief excursion. It's a journey that requires constant adjustments to our planning and presents us with challenges that allow us to grow.

How to transition through challenge is particularly fitting for the times we’re in. The global push for clean energy is clear. Countries are raising their wind energy targets to meet ambitious climate goals. Yet, there’s still a lot we have to do for a future energy system that is both secure and sustainable.  Stable supply chains play a key role in getting there. At Siemens Gamesa we’re reducing reliance on single markets through multiple-supplier sourcing and by encouraging our suppliers to improve their own resilience. This approach mitigates supply chain challenges arising from interdependencies, especially in the face of geopolitical uncertainties.  The wind industry must strike the balance between global supply chains and developing local capacities.

Und wir kooperieren; auch bei Innovationen. Aber: Die Telekommunikationsunternehmen stehen unter Druck. Viele kleinere Betreiber sind nicht einmal in der Lage, ihre Kapitalkosten zu erwirtschaften. Die Telekom hat dabei eine Ausnahmestellung in Europa. Denn wir stehen auf zwei Beinen. In Europa und in den USA. Auf der #MWC2024 haben sich darum die großen europäischen Telkos auf einem Panel zusammengetan. Gemeinsam mit Margherita Della Valle von der Vodafone Group, Christel Heydemann von Orange und José María Álvarez-Pallete von Telefónica schlagen wir einen ""New Deal"" für Europa vor. Es geht nicht um ein einzelnes Unternehmen. Sondern um die Rahmenbedingungen der gesamten Branche. Hier ist unser gemeinsamer Vorschlag dazu, was die EU jetzt tun sollte: 1. Schaffung eines echten digitalen Binnenmarktes Europa. Dazu zählt auch eine Reform des Kartellrechts. Größe muss möglich sein, denn wir brauchen sie. Das gilt ausdrücklich auch für andere Branchen. Wir müssen aufpassen, dass Europa sich nicht selbst „verzwergt“. 2. Das bedeutet: Marktkonsolidierung. In der EU gibt es mehrere Dutzend Anbieter. In Asien oder Nordamerika jeweils nur drei oder vier für hunderte Millionen Menschen. Kein Wunder, dass dort die Investitionen pro Kopf auch höher sind. Wir leben in einer Ökonomie der Plattformen. Und hier geht es um eins: Skaleneffekte. Und von denen profitieren am Ende die Kundinnen und Kunden.3. Fair Share: Wenige Unternehmen produzieren 50 Prozent des gesamten Datenverkehrs und er steigt jährlich um 30 Prozent und mehr. Es gibt keinen ökonomischen Anreiz, diesen Verkehr zu reduzieren oder zu optimieren. Das ist nicht verbraucherfreundlich. Zumal es keine faire Beteiligung an den Investitionen in Infrastruktur gibt, über die diese Daten laufen.4. Reform der Frequenzpolitik: Längere Laufzeiten für Mobilfunkfrequenzen und weniger Versteigerungen können Stabilität für Investitionen und Innovation schaffen.5. Anerkennung von Kommunikationsnetzen in der EU-Taxonomie: Der Telekommunikationssektor spielt eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Ermöglichung von Emissionssenkungen und sollte entsprechend anerkannt werden.6. KI ist gekommen, um zu bleiben: Europa darf bei der Entwicklung und Anwendung von KI nicht ins Hintertreffen geraten und muss sein industrielles Know-how als Wettbewerbsvorteil nutzen. Regulierung ist wichtig. Aber bitte nicht das Kind mit dem Bade ausschütten. Kurz und gut: Wir brauchen einen New Deal in Europa mit weniger Regulierung und gleichen Wettbewerbsbedingungen im Ökosystem. #wewontstop#MWC2024 #MWC24 #Infrastruktur #5G #FTTH",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7168180140580020224

We strive for net-zero emissions. We cooperate, also in innovation. But: Telcos are under pressure. Many smaller operators are not even able to earn back their capital costs. Telekom has a special position in Europe. Because we stand on two legs. Europe and the USA. At #MWC2024 together with Margherita Della Valle from Vodafone Group, Christel Heydemann from Orange, and José María Álvarez-Pallete from Telefónica we suggested a “new deal” for the best digital infrastructure.  Here's our joined take on what the EU should do now: 1. Building a real single market for telcos in Europe: Removing national barriers and promoting cross-border. But to truly scale up, we need an EU competition policy reform for greater competitiveness & resilience, also beyond the telco sector.2. Allowing for more scale through in-market consolidation: With over dozens of operators in the EU, we need to rethink merger regulations to strengthen competition while allowing for network improvements and consumer benefits.3. Deregulating the sector: Time to adapt regulations to reflect new market realities, while fostering competitiveness without sacrificing innovation.4. Fairness in the connectivity ecosystem: Reaching a level-playing field between telcos and large content providers is essential for sustainable growth and investment in infrastructure. Same rules need to apply to same services.5. Reforming spectrum policy: Longer license periods and fewer auctions can provide stability for investment and innovation.6. Recognizing communication networks in the EU Taxonomy: The telco sector plays a crucial role in enabling emission reductions and should be acknowledged accordingly.7. Embracing the AI revolution: Europe must not fall behind in AI development and application, leveraging its industrial expertise for competitive advantage. In a nutshell: We need a new deal in Europe with less regulation and a level playing field in the ecosystem.#MWC2024 #MWC24 #Infrastructure #5G #FTTH",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7168175290337214465

Without the proper infrastructure in place, especially for electricity grids where the growth is unprecedented, there will be no transition. So how do we get there? There are certainly changes needed to Europe’s regulatory environment to unleash the capital we require for the expansion of grids. Eurelectric has estimated that up to €65 billion a year needs to be invested in distribution grids until 2050 – an increase of 84% from today’s levels. Trying political and social times like today are a stark reminder we must ensure the transition is well managed, including a development of the power system that takes a look at system costs.  We have called for an EU Power Infrastructure Deal, creating regulatory simplicity and carving in capital. Such a deal should legislate for anticipatory investments, set clear mandates for NRA’s and give an explicit political signal that grids are in the spotlight to encourage investment. The Grid Action Plan was a welcome step in that direction, now let’s move to the next stage and really drive the change. I thank EVP Sefcovic for this first dialogue dedicated to energy infrastructure and look forward to what we can achieve if we keep the work going!",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7168151694080491521

Den Pragmatismus müssen wir bei der weiteren Ausgestaltung und Umsetzung der Carbon Management Strategie beibehalten.  Denn die Kernfragen sind noch offen, so z.B.: Welche Investitionsmittel stehen welchen Bereichen zu welchem Zeitpunkt zur Verfügung? Das sollte für das nächste Jahrzehnt festgelegt sein, um Planbarkeit für Unternehmen zu schaffen. Außerdem muss die Förderung für CCS auch für Kraftwerke für industrielle Prozesswärme – wie hocheffiziente KWK-Anlagen – gelten, ansonsten könnten viele wichtige Industrieprozesse durchs Raster fallen. Insgesamt mangelt es an einigen Stellen an konkreten Ausgestaltungen. Wie die aussehen können, werden wir in den nächsten Wochen von Seiten der Industrie an die Politik herantragen. Letztlich gilt wie immer: Es ist die Umsetzung, die zählt. Und dafür brauchen wir den Schulterschluss mit der #EU. Wir brauchen schnelle und praxistaugliche Lösungen und einen Fokus auf die Kernfragen.

What fascinates me so much about this 200-year-old book? Alexander von Humboldt was one of the first scientists to understand nature as a system. A system in which everything is interconnected with everything else…in which there is a subtle and fascinating balance between the very large and the very small.   📚 Dave Goulson's book ""Silent Earth"" is about the world of the very small. He focuses on how insects are impacted – sometimes dramatically – by climate change, our consumption habits and our use of resources in general. And in turn, what consequences this impact will have on the world of the big ones (i.e. us humans). In the five chapters: ""Why Insects Matter,"" ""Insect Declines,"" ""Causes of Insect Declines,"" ""Where We Are Headed?"" and ""What Can We Do?,"" Dave shows how we unknowingly at first, but then more and more despite scientific findings, are endangering the balance between large and small – and what we can do better. As a physicist and CEO of a MedTech company, I don't feel particularly competent in the world of insects and ecosystems, but I would like to draw your attention to this book. People who are familiar with it are sensitized to it already, but for those unfamiliar with the topic, it’s important to become aware of it now. #BookRecommendation #Sustainability #Environment",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7166448337288585216

That’s indeed the main message I would like to share when reading the headlines of the new package that the EU Commission published last week on the 2040 climate targets.Even though I am not a fan of “intermediate targets”, I appreciate that the EU holds the line. Just few months ahead of elections where criticism of the EU Green Deal is part of political positioning, this is an important signal to the public, industries and investors. No doubt that the future is decarbonized, with massive electrification powered by renewables. Nevertheless, we still have to stretch to even reach 2030 targets. So, priority should always be to maximize effort for getting things done rather than setting new goals. Complementing renewables by reliable back-up generation and flexibility. Enabling such electrification with modernized and digitized power grids. And with a forward-looking strategy for carbon management in the hardest-to-abate sectors. In my view the receipt for progress and getting society on board is actually the same: Far less bureaucracy and regulatory burdens for everyone, citizens and enterprises, SMEs and large enterprises.

Last year, I presented her with the Aachener #Ingenieurpreis (Aachen Engineering Award) for her remarkable efforts. Her belief that innovations must be scalable at an industrial level is something I deeply admire.Lina-Henriette Schwering, one of only few women in engineering at RWTH Aachen University, is another shining example. As a promising young talent, she has already led Team Sonnenwagen Aachen to win the iLumen European Solar Challenge - iESC. While the project primarily focuses on innovation in sustainable mobility, Lina also demonstrates something else: importance of team performance and individual commitment, factors that can make all the difference in a race – and in developing sustainable solutions. Her passion is truly inspiring.Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim, with her own German TV show ""MAITHINK X"" – and for many year also successful YouTube channel – has shown us how to engage a wider audience, especially the youth, and spark their interest in science and chemistry. She as well has been awarded the Aachen Engineering Award (yes, also as a chemist 😉). I look forward to more insightful content from her.These three women are just a few of the many who are propelling us forward in science and industry. I work with many more brilliant women at Covestro, and today, we celebrate all of you.

What some may not be aware of: this change is also driven by the economy. The chemical industry, for example, is taking responsibility and showing a keen interest in reducing #plastic waste.This shift is not just an obligation to preserve the environment, nature, and climate. It is also an economic necessity. Waste – and particularly used plastic – needs to be seen as a valuable raw material. It mustn't be simply thrown away but should serve as a starting point to produce new products. Products that are needed to make our everyday lives more sustainable.That's why the plastics industry is pushing for a circular economy. At Covestro, we pursue a long-term vision: to become #FullyCircular throughout the company. This means that all our management decisions are geared towards this goal. We are exploring alternative raw materials, investing in renewable energy, developing new recycling technologies, and partnering with other stakeholders to create an effective circular value chain.The #CircularEconomy must become a global guiding principle. To get there, we need support from policymakers. They must set the direction, create the right conditions, and provide the incentives for businesses and consumers to adopt circular economy principles. #ChemicalRecycling, for example, is as a promising new technology that needs to be enhanced.But that's still not all: to truly make a difference, we need an open and constructive discourse on plastics, their role in our everyday lives, their relevance for our sustainable future – and their #FullyCircular transformation.The many comments on my previous post on the topic show that there is a great interest in this discourse and a thirst for information.

Plato's allegory of the cave helped me. We at Deutsche Telekom also sometimes sit in our ""magenta cave"". Because we hide realities. Because we are not transparent in our feedback. Or because we don't know what's happening elsewhere in the Group - no wonder, with such a large organisation. That's why it's important to me that each of us leaves the cave. This gives us a different view of the world, new experiences and new insights. But we also need to return to our cave and share this information and our knowledge. In short: be transparent. That is our duty, our responsibility. Then we can also make the right decisions.  In addition to my colleagues of the Board of Management, I invited many guests to openly discuss transparency and the use of artificial intelligence. A personal highlight was the talk with Mike Sievert and Meredith Whittaker. Their Signal Foundation has developed a messenger for secure private communication. Signal does not monitor conversations and data. The inputs on artificial intelligence from Sebastian Thrun, Henning Beck and Mona Sloane, Ph.D. were also exciting. We often have a tendency not to do things out of fear and caution. Instead, we should integrate new technologies and develop products further in order to utilise all the possibilities. I am convinced that we should all use AI and (learn to) use it responsibly. We must not sit back and relax when it comes to these developments, but must remain constantly vigilant. This is the only way we can bring the future and our strategy - to become the leading digital telco - together. Fabian Riaz was a great musical finale to the long day.

Weil wir bei unserem Feedback nicht transparent sind. Oder weil wir nicht wissen, was an anderen Stellen im Konzern passiert – kein Wunder, bei so einer großen Organisation. Deswegen ist es mir wichtig, dass jeder von uns die Höhle verlässt. Dadurch bekommen wir einen anderen Blick auf die Welt, machen neue Erfahrungen und gewinnen neue Erkenntnisse. Wir müssen aber auch in unsere Höhle zurückkehren und diese Informationen und unser Wissen teilen. Kurz: transparent sein. Das ist unsere Pflicht, unsere Verantwortung.

We answered questions from employees about why trust is so important for customers, which measures can be taken to regain trust between society and non-radical political leaders, how we as Allianz can leverage partnerships for action, and how trust can succeed in a competition for attention and truth.  It was a candid and wide-ranging discussion, and at the end, Richard and I summarized the dialogue in just four words: “Listen. Think. Act. Deliver.”  Allianz will work to protect the freedoms that our people and customers value by mitigating the root causes of polarization and developing solutions that address the issues that are relevant to people. Business leaders are not elected leaders, and we know the limits of our scope, but the private sector can bring know-how, experience, and a customer and execution mindset to solve problems in ways that the public sector cannot.  This is why the path forward will be forged by partnerships – and alliances – that founded on the principles of optimism and inclusion and guided by the compass of trust.  Thank you again to Richard and the colleagues who participated in the conversation both live and online.  Please find here Allianz's statement on recent developments in Germany and the growing polarization around the world: https://lnkd.in/dPBPKzDb#EdelmanTrustBarometer #Trust #Allianz",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7156698352397516800

How is it possible and how can we turn the trend around?  It is possible because on the one hand, the awareness for #CircularEconomy has risen in the past years. Companies and organizations have implemented goals and visions – as did Covestro in 2020. We understand that the linear economy is at an impasse and that we need to transition to a circular model.  But these shiny visions and goals are like a big vessel taking off. Circular solutions take time to develop. Plus, we must not forget that circular products need markets with consumers able and willing to pay (extra) for alternatives that tend to be more expensive, at least in the beginning.   At the same time, consumption has been on steady rise: In just the past six years humankind has consumed nearly as much as during the entire 20th century – according to the Circularity Gap Report 2024.  So, how do we turn this trend around? The Report suggests three levers which I consider sensible and tangible:  1. Establish policies and legal frameworks – incentivize circular practices 2. Get the economics right – create conducive market environments for circular materials 3. Build circular expertise and skills – as individuals and corporations  And I would add a fourth point: Prompt people to reflect on our ways of living in an affluent society and explain why it is worth changing our consumption patterns.   At Covestro, we are doing our part by systematically transforming our production towards circularity: using clean energy and alternative (e.g., bio-based) raw materials, improving recyclability, and recycling, and building partnerships that tie the aforementioned together.  We must tackle this major #CircularEconomy project with courage.

From our thyssenkrupp rothe erde slewing bearings in onshore and offshore wind turbines to our pioneering work in shaping the hydrogen economy through the teams of thyssenkrupp nucera and thyssenkrupp Uhde. Beyond individual technologies, we're transforming entire industries: revolutionizing plant engineering in the chemical and cement sectors, digitizing supply chains, and facilitating the mobility revolution.  At the same time, green steel offers a huge lever for reducing CO2 emissions. It's crucial to highlight this: Accelerating the expansion of renewable energy is imperative to bring down energy costs to a competitive level. The expansion of the electricity grid and hydrogen infrastructure also plays a decisive role in this, which we must create together with a framework set by politicians.Finding answers to these questions is essential. For hashtag#thyssenkrupp, Germany and Europe. Joint solutions always start with an exchange. I am therefore pleased to be part of this year's Handelsblatt Energy Summit in Berlin.

And I know many Siemens colleagues joined the marches. It is right and proper that we take a stand for a free and open society and speak out against right-wing extremism. I find talk of expelling people from Germany very worrying. It’s cynical and inhuman. I reject – we at Siemens reject – extremism, racism and discrimination in the strongest possible terms. We at Siemens – more than 320,000 people from almost every country on earth – stand for tolerance, openness and respect as well as diversity and inclusion – fundamental humanitarian values enshrined in the German constitution. The beliefs of right-wing populists contradict these values. Right-wing extremism harms Germany and is a threat to its prosperity. This prosperity is based on progress and innovation, on openness and the exchange of ideas, on diversity and constancy – and above all on creative and dedicated people. People who come here and want to contribute to society. This is the key to our success. This is why Germany is the third largest economy in the world.   There is no question that we are currently facing major challenges; economically, geopolitically and when it comes to climate change. There are no simple, easy answers. What’s clear is that we can only overcome these challenges together. A divided nation will gamble away the future.   Our social contract is based on freedom, peace and solidarity. This is what made Germany strong and resilient in recent decades, what brought us prosperity and raised our stature in the world.

Last week I had the pleasure of visiting Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham, one of the UK’s largest hospitals and home to an ambitious partnership where E.ON will support QMC’s ambition to become Net Zero by 2038. A crucial part of that? Building and supplying a new heating and cooling network powered by heat pumps and backed up with flexible storage. The project demonstrates an exciting dynamic between public and private sector partnership and shows what can really be done if we have the right instruments in place. Municipalities and public sector buildings face their own unique decarbonisation challenges, but with that also comes opportunities: I’m excited to see the progress of this particular project! The heating transition is clearly not the easiest but a crucial part of the decarbonisation. So we at E.ON  don’t shy away from taking the bull by the horns.

Oliver Bäte,2024-01-20 13:57:37,Text + Album,post,post,1399,13,18,"Attending this week’s World Economic Forum (WEF) was once again a worthwhile experience for me, as I had the opportunity to engage with leaders across various sectors and viewpoints from various perspectives. What I experienced was a spirit of pragmatic optimism and determination to work together to solve the major challenges of our times, from climate change to digital advancement. But the atmosphere in Davos was also influenced by the reality increasing detachment between political leaders and the people who elect them. These issues have an intrinsic connection with the findings of the just-released Allianz Risk Barometer 2024, which sheds light on critical risks impacting businesses around the world. The growing divide between the political elite and their citizens emerges as the number one risk to modern society, posing a risk to global stability and further diminishing trust in governments. Business growth relies on political stability. Business leaders are not elected officials, but our organizations play a pivotal role in addressing polarization and enabling economic stabilization. And, regarding progress, the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer indicates that business is most trusted to integrate innovations into society – at a time when people are more likely to embrace an innovation if they are confident it will lead to a better future.The theme of this year’s WEF was aptly “rebuilding trust.” In my view, this starts with leaders being transparent and honest about the scale of the challenges we face, both economically and in terms of the costs and lifestyle changes required for necessary transformations. From decarbonization to responsible AI to inflation and pension reform, today’s global challenges are opportunities if public and private leaders collaborate on practical solutions that improve the quality of life for all citizens. I believe that the discussions at WEF over the past week have reinforced the urgency for a collaborative, solution-oriented approach. But we must come down from the top of the mountain and bring that spirit back into action - in our boardrooms, workplaces, and communities, showing people that we listen and care about their concerns.At Allianz, we know that we alone cannot solve all the world's problems. This is why we champion collaboration and partnerships to enable collective action. We are confident that the solutions to managing today’s risks also present opportunities for discovery, innovation, and investment. Our chances of restoring public trust are significantly improved when we work together.I am eager to hear your key takeaways from this year’s WEF and learn how your organization is helping to restore trust in your community?

Four things stood out to me from my meetings with politicians, industry experts, and business leaders:➡️ This year will be crucial regarding developments in geopolitics. The recent elections in Taiwan, the upcoming EU elections, and the race for the White House all define our future alliances, trade relationships, and policies. While this puts a lot of focus on 2024, we must ensure that we do not lose sight of our long-term goals. ➡️ Because the fight against climate change is the central task of our time. Just last year, the cost of natural disasters because of climate change amounted to 250 billion euros. 66% of respondents to the WEF’s recently published Global Risk Report named extreme weather the greatest risk society faces today. The success of the energy transition is primarily a question of implementation. It requires the right technologies, political will, and social acceptance. ➡️ No matter where you looked at Davos, the topic of Artificial Intelligence was ever-present. I fully believe that people working in unison with AI have the potential to revolutionize industries, improve efficiencies, and enhance our quality of lifet, if its immense potential is embedded in a framework of values. It is important to keep in mind that today, data centers consume four to five percent of global energy consumption. With AI being implemented into our daily lives, there are estimates that consumption will rise to 30 percent in the next few years. Which brings me to my last point:➡️ The importance of the grid is increasingly being recognized. However, there is growing concern that it could become a bottleneck in our transition towards a more digital and electrified world. As the demand for reliable, efficient, and sustainable power intensifies, the potential for grid constraints also rises. It is imperative that we not only maintain and upgrade our grids but also innovate and invest in solutions that expand their capacity. This is key to preventing infrastructure failures, managing the surge in demand effectively, and facilitating a successful transition towards a more sustainable future.I would be interested to know: for those following the happenings in Davos, what do you think were the most important issues being discussed? #WEF24 #Davos #EnergyTransition #ArtificialIntelligence",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7154045837143089154

We know where that leads. It’s happened before.  Or we choose to convert our uneasiness about tomorrow into focused energy to solve the complex issues of our time. We can choose togetherness and cooperation to breathe life into our democracies. We can try to put ourselves in other people’s shoes. We can uphold the fact that inclusion trumps exclusion.

Public trust strengthens our social fabric, providing greater flexibility and capacity to address complex systemic challenges, like climate change. Unfortunately, in recent years we’ve seen a rise in polarization and social fragmentation around the world. Declining public trust poses a threat to democratic principles, economic stability, and to our collective confidence in the future.  This is the reason why the theme of “rebuilding trust” at next week’s World Economic Forum Annual Meeting is particularly timely and urgent. This year’s event serves as a pivotal platform for leaders from government, business, and civil society to come together, not just to talk but to explore the actions needed to restore trust across various dimensions in an effective and timely way. Private sector leaders play a key role in being constructive partners with government leaders and policymakers. We also play a role through our own cross-collaboration and by building trust through our own example. Trust is earned by developing free market solutions to meet consumer and societal needs, through our sustainable operations and healthy workplaces, and, ultimately, by serving as stabilizing economic forces in our business communities.  I’m looking forward to joining forces with fellow leaders at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. At Allianz, we believe in the transformative power of partnerships to drive positive change, regardless of the challenges we face.

Here's why I think it should not come as a surprise.The foundation has been laid for a long time. A major driver is the process of societal disintegration, fueled by inequality, seclusion, and extremism.Falsehoods spread rapidly in societies already weakened politically and economically, making people more susceptible to false or misleading information and supposedly simple solution that promise stability amidst rising uncertainties.This increasing insecurity and polarization combined with novel new technological capabilities through #AI is especially alarming looking at upcoming political elections in 2024. According to a recent YouGov survey, the proliferation of misleading audio and video deepfakes and political propaganda are the top concerns Americans have about AI (linked in comments).Misinformation and disinformation, particularly during elections, can severely undermine the legitimacy of newly elected governments, leading to political instability, violence, and even terrorism. This makes them a threat to democracy and a hindrance to a sustainable future.Solutions exist and must take effect quickly:▪ Governments are intensifying their fight against fake news and conspiracy theories, imposing stronger sanctions on the deliberate spread of misinformation, and launching initiatives to raise awareness.▪ Fact-based discourse is being promoted to counter increasing polarization, with media and independent fact checkers taking a stand against fake news and conspiracy theories.▪ Finally, the private sector is also taking a stronger stand against fake news, demonstrating that combating misinformation and disinformation is a collective responsibility.All of us must be on guard and foster critical thinking and rationality as the best remedy against manipulation and division.

Danke Philipp Krohn für die nuancierte Darstellung in der Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.Mechanisches Recycling ist eine bewährte Technologie, die bereits in großem Umfang eingesetzt wird. Es ist energieeffizient und ermöglicht die Wiederverwendung vieler Kunststoffprodukte wie PET-Flaschen. Allerdings kommt das Verfahren bei komplexen Kunststoffarten und stark verschmutztem Plastikmüll an seine Grenzen und kann die Qualität des recycelten Materials beeinträchtigen – Stichwort Downcycling.Chemisches Recycling ermöglicht es, Kunststoffe auf molekularer Ebene zu zerlegen. Kunststoffe, die bisher als nicht recycelbar galten, können in hochwertige Rohstoffe umgewandelt werden. Diese Rezyklate und ihre fossilen Pendants sind chemisch identisch und haben eine gleichbleibende, hohe Qualität. Das Verfahren hat also großes Potential, ist jedoch weitaus weniger entwickelt und entsprechend kosten- und energieintensiv.Um es ganz klar zu sagen: Chemisches Recycling steht nicht in Konkurrenz zum mechanischen Recycling. Es setzt vielmehr da an, wo mechanisches Recycling nicht mehr greift.

But my career in the risk management-based insurance industry has strengthened my belief and confidence in the ability of determined individuals to find solutions to even the world’s most entrenched problems. Having an optimistic perspective is not a matter of feeling lucky. Optimism, in my view, stems from confidence in expertise and a proactive approach to challenges, with a focus on seeking innovative solutions. In a compelling Vox article, Hannah Ritchie, a researcher at the University of Oxford, emphasizes that we need optimists who believe that the future can be shaped by the decisions we make today. I couldn’t agree more.  There are many optimist changemakers amongst us today – such as those innovating solutions to reduce our environmental impact, feed a growing population, and reduce health risks. Their optimistic mindset encourages collaboration, recognizing that complex problems require collective efforts for effective solutions.  How can we cultivate a more optimistic outlook? One effective approach is to look beyond negative headlines and focus on reliable data that highlights positive developments amid challenges. Here are just a few exciting developments we saw in the past year:  1. Global flow of capital has shifted towards clean energy with investments in renewables outpacing those in fossil fuels. We at Allianz are proud to own over 100 wind and solar farms, contributing to this transformative shift.2. Led by new solar power, the world added renewable energy at breakneck speed in 2023. By 2025, renewable power is expected to become the primary global electricity source, achieving 91% of global electricity access, a significant increase from 84% in 2010.3. Child mortality is decreasing. The rate at which children died before age 5 was estimated to have dropped from 3.6% in 2021 down to 3.5% in 2022. While this is still too high, it is the lowest global number ever estimated.4. Women CEOs in Fortune 500 companies reached an all-time high at 10.6% in 2023, with 53 women leading major firms, and the percentage of women on Fortune 500 boards increased from 9.6% in 1995 to 30.4% in 2022. These achievements signal a strategic shift towards a more sustainable, resilient, equitable and interconnected world. While there’s no denying these are challenging times, I remain optimistic about the future, anticipating continued innovative momentum in 2024. As we welcome the new year, I encourage you to embrace a spirit of optimism into 2024. Every positive step we take collectively contributes to a brighter and more hopeful future for everyone.

It is crucial that we transition from fossil resources to renewable sources in order to achieve climate neutrality. However, it is not enough to simply switch to renewables. We must also focus on using our energy more efficiently, particularly in buildings which account for a significant portion of energy consumption and CO₂ emissions. At Covestro, we are already working on developing efficient insulating materials, such as polyurethane foam, which has the lowest thermal conductivity. Additionally, we are able to produce components for this foam in a climate neutral way. BUT: political impetus is necessary to drive these changes forward. The recent agreement of the EU institutions on the directive for more energy efficiency in buildings is a step in the right direction, but by far not enough to achieve the EU's climate targets.

Leo Birnbaum,2024-01-03 09:18:33,Text + Photo,post,post,993,40,13,"Als Optimist glaube ich, wir sollten von 2024 in Deutschland und Europa nicht zu viel erwarten. Und gerade darin liegt die Chance. Klingt widersprüchlich? Dann will ich anhand von drei Thesen erklären, wie wir dieses Jahr zu einem guten machen können.Erstens: REALISMUS macht uns handlungsfähig.2020 und 2021 waren von der Corona Krise geprägt, 2022 von Russlands Einmarsch in die Ukraine, 2023 eskalierte der Nahost-Konflikt. Zugleich zeigten sich schon 2023 rezessive Tendenzen, und der abrupte Zinsanstieg wirkt weiter nach. Dass wir also auch 2024 irgendeine Krise erleben, ist wahrscheinlich. Doch es wird weitergehen. Und Krisenbewältigung funktioniert am besten mit kühlem Kopf und einer realistischen Erwartungshaltung.Zweitens: EHRLICHKEIT ist die wichtigste Prämisse.Die latente Unzufriedenheit der Bevölkerung wird nicht über Nacht verschwinden, weil strukturelle Probleme wie die Bürokratie nicht durch Sonntagsreden gelöst werden. Und auch in punkto Wirtschaft und Energie muss man ehrlich sein: Die Abkehr von russischem Gas hat die Beschaffung von Strom und Gas strukturell verteuert. Und die Alternative – noch schneller, noch mehr Erneuerbare – kommt nicht zum Nulltarif. Denn nicht zuletzt der so dringend benötigte Netzausbau ist durch Bürokratie erschwert und wurde durch den sprunghaften Anstieg der Kapitalkosten verteuert. Auf der anderen Seite erhöht ein Tempoverlust beim Ausbau dieser Infrastruktur die Systemkosten für die Volkswirtschaft. Zur Ehrlichkeit gehört also: Das einfache, positive Narrativ eines vergleichsweisen schmerzlosen Übergangs, ohne die Gefahr von Wohlstandsverlusten, sondern im Gegenteil, mit dem Gewinn von Wettbewerbsfähigkeit, in eine neue Welt billiger und nachhaltiger Energie, ist Geschichte. Manches davon hat die Politik schlicht nicht in der Hand, egal welche Parteien die Regierung stellen. Kommuniziert sie dies ehrlich, kann sie Vertrauen zurückgewinnen. Drittens: PRAGMATISCH wird es vielleicht nicht perfekt, aber sicher mal besser. 100% Lösungen kann und muss es nicht geben, auch 2024 nicht. Umso wichtiger ist es, dass die Gesetzgebung in Europa dies endlich erkennt. Dann würden wir Kernthemen wie Wasserstoff, ESG und Digitalisierung/KI nicht mehr tot diskutieren und bis ins Detail regeln. Und wir würden nicht mehr erstaunt nach Übersee blicken, weil andere schneller sind und sich Zukunftstechnologien dort entwickeln.

Die Chemie steht zweifellos vor großen Herausforderungen, wie die Börsen-Zeitung berichtet. Um diesen Herausforderungen entgegenzuwirken, müssen wir schnell konkrete Maßnahmen ergreifen.  Ein wichtiger Hebel: erneuerbare Energien. Deutschland hat den Ausstieg aus Kohle und Gas vorverlegt, es aber nicht geschafft, die Erneuerbaren entsprechend auszubauen. Damit ist nicht nur unsere Wettbewerbsfähigkeit, sondern auch die Sicherheit der Energieversorgung gefährdet. Anstatt den Ausbau der Erneuerbaren weiter zu verknappen, muss die Bundesregierung jetzt endlich Tempo aufnehmen und die Rahmenbedingungen schaffen, um die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der deutschen Chemieindustrie zu erhalten. https://lnkd.in/eCeNdKKF #Chemieindustrie #Energie",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7147980127555973120

His world in the early 2000s was slowly awaking to the idea of a shift from a linear system of take, make, and waste, to a more circular, sustainable one. On a brisk Christmas Eve, under the soft glow of Y2K lights, Mark's curiosity led him to find a time machine. His mind, teeming with questions about the environmental trajectory, compelled him to embark on a journey through time. Fueled by this spirit, he traveled to the 1980s. There, amidst a booming economy, he witnessed firsthand the signs of a looming triple crisis: escalating climate change, diminishing livelihoods, and environmental degradation. This era's unsustainable growth and reliance on fossil resources stood in stark contrast to the emerging sustainable practices. With insights from the past, Mark propelled himself to 2023. There, he found a world actively striving towards a #CircularEconomy, yet still wrestling with the legacies of past decades – continuing struggles with waste management and carbon emissions, but also notable advancements in sustainable practices and technologies.  His journey through time complete, Mark returned to the early 2000s, a period rich with potential for change. The challenges of the sustainability transformation, he understood, were not insurmountable barriers but opportunities for creativity and progress. This understanding fueled his determination to contribute actively to shaping a sustainable path forward together with his valued like-minded colleagues and partners. And so, he lived busily but happily ever after and wishes everyone a season of joy and a future filled with sustainable endeavors.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7143963787086221312

It was the proof that the EU has taken good care of one of its most precious assets, the internal electricity market.  Elsewhere, I must say that I am disappointed reading news from Brussels last week. In particular, the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive as agreed last week appears to be another example of additional bureaucracy. And not only for large companies, because nearly all smaller companies are suppliers of large companies and will be forced by them to report under the CS3D. The resulting reporting liability is disproportionate.  The EU announced its willingness to reduce the reporting burden for companies by 25%. I am pretty sure that this Directive is not going to help. I really hope that the promised reduction of bureaucracy will become a clear commitment of the European institutions and that it will materialize as soon as possible in real life. We often say “Jetzt machen”, just do it!  Another example of increasing bureaucracy? Take the AI Act. It’s fundamentally naive to think that we can achieve leadership in a cutting-edge technology by leading on its regulation. This will not work, especially when the tech is already developing elsewhere – which is the case of AI.   Don’t get me wrong: it is certainly right to ensure a responsible use of AI and the risk-based approach is also to be welcomed. However, good intentions don’t necessarily mean good results. I am missing a focus on the opportunities of the technology. I am missing an approach how to make much more data easily available. I am missing the understanding that AI will be indispensable for a modern society. I am missing an acknowledgement that innovation is our source of wealth – and not regulation.

Investing in ClimateTech solutions is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. A recent report from Allianz Economic Research throws a light on the current investment gaps facing European ClimateTech start-ups, threatening an innovation lag behind the U.S. and China. Strong partnerships between public and private investors are key to reversing this course and improving the competitiveness of Europe’s ClimateTech industry. Policymakers can help to establish a unified EU platform, streamline bureaucracy, and update regulation. Closer collaboration is also needed between investors and universities, to build robust research ecosystems, catalyse innovation and fast-track ClimateTech innovation hubs.  Although our report focuses on Europe, the ClimateTech race is global. The economic opportunity in the net-zero transformation is enormous and progress from around the world continues to impress me, from rapid advances in making renewable energy accessible and affordable to groundbreaking policies that are helping communities adapt to living with climate risks. This is a decisive moment for policymakers, industry players, investors, and scientific institutions.

As Eurelectric’s recent Power Barometer shows, EU penetration rate of smart meters is increasing, standing at 56% on average across Member States. The rollout has been particularly successful in both Southern Europe and Scandinavia, where a near 100% rollout has been achieved in a number of countries. Consumers there will be able to benefit from more innovative products, potentially bringing bills down whilst participating more effectively in the smart energy system that must be everyone’s future.Now let’s move onto the bad news: Germany and much of Central and Eastern Europe is seriously lagging behind. A penetration rate of less than 1% puts Germany pretty much at the bottom of the pile – not a new development but also not an excuse.

The competitiveness struggle is real and we need to talk about it! It is good that the EU-COM now spends serious time to listen to industry. Yesterday I joined the Clean Transition Dialogue organised by the European Commission and Executive Vice President Maroš Šefčovič, this time with energy intensive industries. To foster industrial competitiveness can only be done in a true European framework. Now we need to continue to talk about how the costs and benefits of the transition are fairly distributed between industry and society. A difficult discussion but a necessary one!  In her opening remarks President Ursula von der Leyen said “the real long-term solution to bring prices down is to keep investing in home-grown clean energy” and this is of course true. But perhaps if I could make one addition to that it would be “...and our grid infrastructure”. We cannot achieve this transition without it. The costs of action on grid infrastructure will be great but the cost of inaction will be even greater. The Grid Action Plan announced this week was a welcome step on this road, I look forward to working with our industry, regulators and consumers on its implementation.  On Wednesday I also had the pleasure of meeting Minister Tinne Van der Straeten and would like to thank her and Eurelectric colleagues for sharing thoughts ahead of the Belgian EU Presidency in the first half of 2024, and the emphasis on energy sovereignty.

Secondly, it underscores the urgent need for a sustainable shift in the plastics industry. The plastics industry is one of the largest GHG producers, with plastics accounting for ca. 3.4% of global emissions. With the expected rise in plastics demand comes an expected increase in global oil consumption as carbon from crude oil currently forms the basis of most plastics. On top of that, plastic pollution remains a pressing issue as global recycling rates are still extremely low. If we continue this trajectory, resource depletion and pollution will continue to rise as plastics production increases. At the same time, we must keep in mind that plastics are essential in various applications of our modern life. Plastics drive climate action in core areas like energy, mobility, and construction. They secure nutrition and improve health, contributing to the well-being and living standards of billions of people. So, the challenge is not to eliminate plastics, but to transform the way we produce and use them. The #CircularEconomy must become our global guiding principle. By keeping carbon in the loop, we can reduce pollution and resource depletion while still supplying vital industries with versatile plastics. This comprehensive transformation is a joint effort that includes various aspects such as designing for circularity, exploring alternative raw materials, accelerating recycling, and using renewable energy in production. In conclusion, this graphic should not be a cause for alarm, but rather a catalyst for action. It should ignite our determination to tirelessly work on solutions for a #FullyCircular economy. And for this we need all hands on deck: an industry committed to circularity, politics establishing the right frameworks, and a society that manages plastics responsibly.

Demnach steigt bis 2030 weltweit die Zahl der E-Autos und Wärmepumpen massiv; auch der Anteil der Erneuerbaren im Strommix wächst auf fast 50 Prozent. Das bietet Chancen für mehr Wachstum und mehr Arbeitsplätze und auch für ein besseres Klima. Gut so! Der Bericht der Internationalen Energiebehörde (Link: https://www.iea.org/) mahnt aber auch weitere Anstrengungen zum Erreichen des 1,5-Grad-Ziels an: Halten die Regierungen „nur“ an ihren Maßnahmen zum Klimaschutz fest und steigern sie ihre Ambitionen nicht, bleibt der Anteil der fossilen Brennstoffe dennoch zu hoch und die globalen Durchschnittstemperaturen steigen bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts um etwa 2,4 Grad. Wir müssen also schneller werden!Das Tempo, mit dem wir unsere Klimaziele erreichen, hängt nach meiner Einschätzung in besonderem Maße davon ab, ob und wie wir in der Lage sind, die (Netz-)Infrastruktur für ein nachhaltiges Energiesystem zu finanzieren – siehe auch mein gestriger Post zur Hashtag#COP28. Das ist ein Thema, das auch die Entwicklung in Deutschland mehr und mehr beeinflusst. Dabei geht es nicht nur um staatliche Ausgaben (Link: https://lnkd.in/eKaCXa3Z) Es geht insbesondere um das immer komplexere Finanzierungsumfeld mit steigenden Zinsen,  immer mehr Regulierung und Bürokratie, aber beispielsweise auch wachsende Abhängigkeiten von Rohstofflieferanten.

I made crystal clear: The electricity market design reform must ensure a clear, stable and technology-neutral regulatory environment to foster the urgent roll-out of renewables and greater investments in the power distribution system which supports them. At stake is our success in delivering the 2030 targets. We have no time to loose: We need to double investments in the grids in the next 6 years. In particular in distribution grids, investments should increase to at least €36 billion per year until 2030 and, on average, up to €65 billion per year until 2050. We all know, that the incremental approach to build infrastructure does not work anymore. If we want the grid to be ready for the rapidly growing production of renewable energy, we need to re-build the capacity reserves that we have eaten through. We need “anticipatory investments”.

For some time now we focused on expanding clean generation capacity, a most important goal especially as we have had to not only replace, but also displace volumes of imported gas. But while one foot was on the gas pedal on the RES expansion, one foot on the brake prevented the network capacity from growing. We need acceleration and anticipation, and the regulatory de-risking of the investments we make based on forecast. The massive scale of investment in the power grids, estimated between 584bn to 1 trillion by 2030 EUR depending on the source, in itself is truly impressive. But at least equally impressive is how fast we will have to be able to deploy: the capital, the technicians, the permits, the equipment and the flexibility. It’s a massive collective task that must be done in anticipation of generation projects, new consumers, not after the fact.

Oliver Bäte,2023-11-16 12:50:47,Text + Photo,post,post,496,6,8,"One of the many reasons that I love my job is that institutional investing and insurance is naturally oriented toward the future. Our long-term obligations and need to safeguard our portfolios for future generations makes us futurists, always focused on emerging risks and opportunities, and those that lay far ahead. For this reason, many insurers and institutional investors have been out in front of the climate crisis, foreseeing the dangers of global warming and investing in innovative solutions to mitigate it. We have learned much through investing in renewable energy technologies and green transformations. One structuring approach is blended finance – a model in which projects are financed out of both catalytic funding from public or philanthropic sources and private sector capital. Blended finance has great potential to mobilize a brave and rapid economic transformation, helping us achieve our ambitious climate goals faster. At Allianz, we see blended finance structures already making a positive impact in Africa. And we’re confident that its innovative approach can unlock public/private investment in the European Union and beyond.  I was recently asked to contribute a chapter for “Germany 2030 – Decade of Decision,” a new book about how to accelerate an intelligent, sustainable transformation while also strengthening Germany and Europe as a global, competitive, and efficient location for industry and tech. In it, I argue that we need to dare to do more blended finance, if we want to protect Europe from the worst scenarios of climate change. I outline specific steps that governments and regulators can take to scale the power of blended finance at the necessary pace. We’re living in a pivotal decade of environmental, social, and economic transformation, requiring creative thinking, foresight, and courage. “The Decade of Decision 2030,” edited by Christian Lindner, Federal Minister of Finance for Germany, Robert Habeck, Federal Minister of Economics and Climate Protection for Germany, and Stefan B. Wintels, Chairman of the Executive Board of KfW, is an impressive collection of pioneering thinkers from many sectors. I am honored to be included amongst them.

A huge thank you to the joint Team Purple for your hard work and dedication through the partially rough waters of the past months. I know it hasn’t been easy, but together we have navigated as good as possible through a year of unprecedented challenges. If we take a moment to review the performance of the majority of our business areas – Gas Services, Grid Technologies, and Transformations of Industry – we saw significant revenue growth, impressive margin improvements, and strong cash flow all round. By surpassing their full-year targets, these areas exemplify a turnaround that many might have deemed impossible just three years ago. The wind business remains a major challenge and has led to a net loss in 2023. As a result, we have initiated remediation measures. Our primary focus remains on resolving these issues and ensuring a turnaround, just as we have seen in our other business areas. One of the actions we have been working on to strengthen our company has been the subject of much speculation in recent weeks. To clarify: yes, we have come to an agreement with the German government, a consortium of banks, and Siemens AG to provide counter-guarantees to secure our strong growth. It is important to emphasize that this does not use taxpayers’ money. This practice is common in the project business, and some of you may be familiar with the concept on a smaller scale, such as receiving an advance payment guarantee from a tradesperson for a service. This helps us to ensure the viability of large industrial projects we have in the pipeline. I believe in Siemens Energy, Team Purple, and our purpose: to energize society.

In der Pandemie haben wir gelernt, dass es Leben rettet, sich an der hashtag#Wissenschaft zu orientieren, Inzidenzen zu beobachten, den Erfolg von Gegenmaßnahmen zu messen und ein Bewusstsein für die ""nationale Gesundheit"" zu schaffen. Wir haben ebenfalls gelernt, dass hashtag#Technologien wie Telemedizin die Lücke zwischen Arzt und Patient schließen, wenn beide nicht persönlich zusammenkommen können; zudem sind KI-basierte Assistenten in die Bresche gesprungen, um Ärzte in Phasen hoher Belastung bei klinischen Entscheidungen zu unterstützen.

In fact, the German chemical industry's hydrogen consumption is expected to multiply by eight in the coming years, leading to a demand of up to 283 TWh of hydrogen. This demand will likely surpass Germany's national production capacities.To meet the demand, large-scale imports of green hydrogen will be necessary. This is where securing a hydrogen infrastructure becomes paramount: The Netherlands, particularly the port of Rotterdam, will play a crucial role as an import and transport hub to meet Germany's hydrogen demand.Cross EU partnerships, such as the one with the Netherlands, are instrumental in driving our industry's transition to climate neutrality. Today, we made a significant stride in this direction with King Willem-Alexander and Hendrik Wüst.

Nein, das war Realität und wurde weltweit bewundert. Dokumentiert hat dies Mark Twain, Autor von Tom Sawyer und Huckleberry Finn, der seinerzeit vor allem auch als Reiseschriftsteller bekannt war. In seinem „Bummel durch Deutschland“ von 1880 gibt er diese bewundernde Beschreibung des Baus von Bahnhöfen, bevor Schienen fertig sind und der Verkehr beginnt:„Überall am Fluss entlang sahen wie in der Nähe eines jeden Dorfes kleine Bahnhöfe für die zukünftige Eisenbahn. Sie waren bereits fertig und warteten nur noch auf die Schienen und den Verkehr. Sie sahen so Schmuck und niedlich und hübsch aus, wie man sie sich nur immer wünschen konnte. Stets waren sie aus Ziegeln oder Bruchsteinen gebaut und von anmutigem Äußeren; sie wurden schon jetzt von Reben und Blumen am Rand, und um See her war das Gras frisch und grün, und man sah, dass es liebevoll gepflegt wurde. Die Bahnhöfe waren alles andere als ein Ärgernis, sie waren eine Zierde der schönen Landschaft. […] Ein Land so wunderschön in Stand zu halten, wie Deutschland es tut, hat über dies noch eine kluge, praktische Seite: Tausende von Menschen haben Arbeit und Brot, die sonst müßig gehen und Unheil stiften würden.“ Wie wäre es – verwegener Gedanke – wenn wir hier uns beim Ausbau der Energieinfrastruktur hieran ein Beispiel nähmen?",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7130236279044104194

At China International Import Expo, I had the opportunity to witness their potential impact on three key industries: construction, automotive, and renewable energy.Buildings are responsible for over half of China's emissions, making ""ultra-low energy buildings"" a significant factor in the country's journey to net-zero. Polyurethanes, initially used in refrigeration, have immense potential to boost energy efficiency in #construction without sacrificing aesthetics. Our partnerships with property developers PDG Group and Shanghai Lujiazui Development (Group) Company Limited are accelerating the adoption of such sustainable construction practices in China, helping to meet the country's climate targets.Similarly, the #automotive industry is making intensive efforts in decarbonization, aiming to create lighter, smarter, and safer vehicles. Plastics manufacturers, including Covestro, can contribute to this transition by providing circular, low-carbon materials such as polycarbonates for electric vehicles. Through partnerships like the one we have with Chinese premium EV brand HiPhi, we are driving the commercialization of such low-carbon solutions, enabling even more car manufacturers to use these materials in the future.China is reforming its #energy sector, increasingly focusing on clean energy, especially solar power. With this shift comes a rising demand for PV modules. Plastics with their unique properties help making PV modules lighter, more durable, efficient, and sustainable. A new innovation platform we created with five partners in China's PV value chain aims to further advance sustainability within the sector. The numerous conversations I had at #CIIE2023 confirmed that innovative materials like plastics are needed more than ever to drive progress towards a truly #SustainableFuture.

Dieses befristete Mittel brauchen wir jetzt, damit Deutschland auch künftig von einer starken Industrie profitieren kann. Die energieintensive Industrie liefert jährlich etwa 240 Milliarden Euro an Bruttowertschöpfung und stellt 2,4 Millionen Arbeitsplätze. Sie ist ein wichtiges Bindeglied in Wertschöpfungsketten und produziert essenzielle Produkte für die #Energiewende und für unser tägliches Leben.

Ohne #Kunststoffe gibt es kein Smartphone, keinen Kühlschrank, dreht sich kein Windrad und fährt auch kein Elektroauto. Kurzum: Wir sind nicht nur Teil des Problems, sondern auch ein entscheidender Teil der Lösung. Wie also gelingt es Chemie- und Kunststoffunternehmen eine Kreislaufwirtschaft konkret umzusetzen? Bei Covestro konzentrieren wir uns auf vier Säulen, die als Katalysatoren für den historischen Wandel dienen: 1. Einsatz erneuerbarer #Rohstoffe anstelle von Erdöl: Wir setzen verstärkt auf Rohstoffe, die auf Biomasse und Bioabfällen basieren, und forschen an weiteren erneuerbaren Rohstoffen. 2. Betrieb unserer Anlagen mit erneuerbarer #Energie: Wir stellen unsere Standorte weltweit schrittweise auf erneuerbare Energien um und setzen dabei auf langfristige Großlieferverträge mit Energieanbietern. 3. Entwicklung innovativer #Recyclingverfahren: Wir treiben die Entwicklung von chemischen Recyclingverfahren voran, um Kunststoffabfall im großen Stil als Rohstoff nutzen zu können. 4. Förderung von #Partnerschaften: Wir setzen auf Kooperationen, um neue Technologien und Geschäftsmodelle zu entwickeln und den Kreislauf vollständig zu schließen. Der Weg in die Kreislaufwirtschaft ist nicht einfach, aber richtig.

A legend is a legend – a legend is “ingoodbyeable”… 😊 Accordingly, I’m writing just a few thoughts on Thomas Flohr here – no more, no less. To claim that Thomas played a pivotal role in defining and shaping #ComputedTomography (CT) at Siemens Healthineers would be equally blatant and inaccurate. As a matter of fact, without him, the history of CT – at least at Siemens Healthineers, perhaps even overall – would have taken a very different course. After all, he is one of THE key persons to whom we owe our global #innovation and market #leadership in CT.Whether it is spiral CT, multi-slice CT, cardio CT, 3D post-processing applications, dual-source CT, or photon counting CT – Thomas has been one of the driving forces behind these pioneering breakthroughs, that provide crucial diagnostic information to hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide, every day. Ever more precise. Ever faster. Ever patient friendlier. Around 200 patents and awards, such as the Siemens Innovator of the Year and three times finalist for the Deutscher Zukunftspreis of the German Federal President, seem almost secondary compared to his legendary reputation among customers and research partners. Thomas adds weight to a discussion simply by attending – everyone knows, he only deals with the essentials.You won’t hear anything half-baked from him – when he speaks up, it’s important! I learned that many years ago and have never forgotten it. When I took over the leadership of our CT business in 2004, we – literally – exchanged ideas intensively, meaning: I went into the discussion with MY opinion and came out of the discussion with HIS opinion. This seemed quite normal to me, thanks to Thomas’ amazing talent for simplifying complex matters. Usually, you only recognize that the discussion had been around tricky topics, when you try to put into your own words what you have learned and fail – “what did he say again??”Throughout his career at #SiemensHealthineers, Thomas Flohr has embodied what we summed up two years ago as the purpose of our company: We pioneer breakthroughs in healthcare – for everyone, everywhere.

Their work provides important insight into the factors impacting wealth formation around the globe. This year’s report explores wealth in the context of geopolitical, environmental, and economic transition. It shows how inflation and geopolitical tensions are generally dampening wealth growth but also spotlights how individual savings practices and investing strategies in certain markets help many avoid stagnation.  These macro insights inform how we at Allianz work with our customers across our 70 different global markets, helping them navigate economic headwinds to optimize growth. As the report makes clear, there is much work still to do. Globally, wealth remains concentrated in too few hands. Reversing this trajectory and literally “spreading the wealth” requires new ways of thinking and operating, including leveraging the massive growth opportunities in decarbonization and digitalization. It also requires a broadening of fundamental financial literacy, which the report spotlights as a key driver in long-term individual wealth formation.   To learn more about other key findings from the Allianz Global Wealth Report, check out the full report here: https://lnkd.in/ewkWTJtz #FinancialLiteracy #AllianzGlobalWealthReport #Allianz",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7112347102176759809

When UN Secretary-General António Guterres launched this summit, he warned that “the price of entry is non-negotiable – credible, serious and new climate action and nature-based solutions that move the needle forward and respond to the urgency of the climate crisis."" He created the Summit to accelerate action by governments, business, finance, local authorities, and civil society, and hear from “first movers and doers.” I am grateful to our employees who work tirelessly to put Allianz in the “first movers and doers” category. Mitigating climate change is a huge growth opportunity that requires a global transformation. Individuals and companies cannot achieve this alone and yet we must all take a stand and lead by example. This is what Allianz did when we published our net zero transition plan a few day ago, in line with UN-backed credibility criteria. And, what we did in 2019, when Allianz joined with other investors to launch the UN convened Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), which we chair. Today, the NZAOA’s 86 members include insurers, pension funds, foundations, and endowments -- all committed to moving their investment portfolios to net zero by 2050. The NZAOA truly is leading the way. The majority of its members, including Allianz, have already set credible intermediate net-zero targets for 2025 or 2030. But the world has profoundly changed since 2019. The era of geopolitical stability, robust economic growth and low inflation has been eroded by uncertainty, volatility, and war. The resulting polarization and conflict are the enemies of a carbon neutral world. They distract us from making bold changes and developing the cross-disciplinary, multi-lateral solutions needed to achieve a net zero planet. My message today at the United Nations was clear. We cannot allow polarization to breed distrust that prevents effective climate partnerships. Organizing resources around our common goal is the only way to solve a problem as systemic as climate change, and this requires a united global community. To avert climate disaster, we need to unify. We also need to be honest and transparent about costs and trade-offs. 2050 targets for a “sustainable future” is an abstract message for those struggling to put food on the table today. Policymakers must focus on pragmatic, market-based solutions that reflect economic realities and deliver tangible benefits. Our net-zero journey will be challenging, but we are committed to act through transparent and tangible transition plans. The UN-convened Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance is an invaluable partner for driving the transition.

It was inspiring to meet Nigeria's president Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and to feel the momentum of the country and how he has put healthcare next to education at the center of his presidency. I was humbled by how much time President João Lourenço of Angola took to discuss the way forward to fight the NCDs (non-communicable diseases) like cancer together. In the conversation with the Minister of Health of Uzbekistan, his Excellency Amrillo Inoyatov, we intensively discussed our Access-to-Care strategy against the backdrop of the needs of his country, and I was very impressed by his vision of collaboration. And talking about tackling healthcare challenges in Europe, the open exchange with Will Quince, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Social Care of the United Kingdom, showed how much we can contribute: as an employer of more than 3,000 Healthineers in the UK, as a research partner for the leading academic medical centers, and most importantly as a long-term partner of more and more NHS trusts.  Finally, I am very proud that we have entered into a very concrete agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to support low- and middle-income countries with diagnosing and fighting cancer.

Don't worry, you're not alone there, only experts can understand. Looks like a lot of bureaucracy? Indeed, especially because there is no sign that the frameworks will be harmonized for at least the next two years. Is a job creation program for consultants and auditors? Absolutely, because a medium-sized company cannot afford such a great specialist department as I have. Nevertheless, the reporting of numerous different KPIs also leads to avoidable costs for us and certainly does not make us any faster in the energy transition.So: reducing bureaucracy is more than just digitizing the residents' registration office.

The more waste we retrieved from the area, the more colleagues I got to speak with and learn from, all while collectively contributing to a cleaner environment. This year's clean-up reminded me once again about the need to address waste pollution – we mustn’t allow the crises we’ve been dealing with in the past years to distract us from this important issue. We must go beyond surface-level actions and change our fundamental thinking to avoid creating another crisis to deal with in the future. Transitioning from the traditional linear to the emerging #CircularEconomy requires dedication and collaboration across the entire value chain. This involves educating ourselves and our stakeholders about responsible consumption, designing for recycling, improving waste management and recycling methods, and, ultimately, creating profitable markets for #recycled and #renewable materials. As the clean-up event in Dormagen was coming to an end, we lined up to take a group picture with all the waste we had collected. It’s one of my favorite clean-up moments when we realize what we had achieved together, and that by just picking it up from the beach we managed to give waste a chance to become a valuable raw material for new useful products. To my colleagues participating in clean-ups worldwide: Thank you for your commitment and action for a cleaner environment — at work and at the clean-ups. #WorldCleanupDay #FullyCircular #cleanupday",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7108799968114565120

As Robert Habeck, Germany’s Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, said in his opening speech in Husum: “Within eight years, we need to double the capacity of wind turbines we’ve built in the last more than twenty years. Within eight years, we need to more than triple the capacity of hashtag#offshore turbines. That means that with the existing practice of permitting, planning, zoning, and political gridlock, we're not going to achieve that goal.”  So “quo vadis?” Where is the expansion of Germany’s and Europe’s wind energy headed? What about us manufacturers who bear the greatest risk in the value chain? And what is the role of hashtag#IndustrialPolicy at this pivotal moment?  These were some of the questions we discussed at the hashtag#HusumWind2023 panel of VDMA, the largest network organization for the machinery and equipment manufacturing industry in Germany and Europe. My take on what Europe’s wind industry needs right now:  🔹 Speedy hashtag#PermittingProcesses – European wind power projects with a capacity of 80 gigawatts are currently awaiting approval. 🔹 Mechanisms to compensate for inflation, and no additional bid payments in auctions for hashtag#WindPowerProjects. 🔹 Sufficient financing which includes guarantees to strengthen the industry and supply chains and, ultimately, Europe’s competitiveness.🔹 Qualitative auction criteria that recognize the value of the European renewables supply chain.🔹 Fair competition, a hashtag#LevelPlayingField among all global manufacturers, and supportive trade agreements to protect the climate and ensure access to key global supply chains. We at Siemens Gamesa are in a difficult moment. And we are working tirelessly to get through it. Because we know that if policymakers continue to adjust the framework conditions we need, manufacturers like Siemens Gamesa will play an important role in transforming our energy systems. As I shared here a couple of days ago, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a hashtag#EuropeanWindPower package to address the points above by “working closely with industry and member states.” This is a promising step forward. And it is motivation enough for us to live up to our own ambitions.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7108402924732432384

One thing is clear to all of us: the biggest challenge confronting our society is the fight against climate change. For us, and the economy, this means the green hashtag#transformation of an entire hashtag#industry.Over recent years, our focus has been on embracing innovative technologies. The reports of my colleagues yesterday have highlighted that this foresight enables us to exploit the enormous opportunities of the green transformation – for us and for our customers. At thyssenkrupp, we are in the unique position to cover the entire hashtag#hydrogen value chain. To leverage these synergies and strengthen our performance, we are uniting our key technologies for green transformation with in a new segment: thyssenkrupp Decarbon Technologies.With our hashtag#slewingbearings from thyssenkrupp rothe erde, we are paving the way for the energy transition. As global number 1, our products are used by almost all well-known manufacturers of wind turbines. The global expansion plans for onshore and offshore wind farms are gigantic – and so are the growth opportunities for thyssenkrupp rothe erde.Without renewable energy, there can be no green hydrogen. A critical need for the industry. thyssenkrupp nucera, a world leading supplier of hashtag#electrolysis plants for the production of green hydrogen on a large scale. The successful hashtag#IPO and quick listing in SDAX have once again shown the enormous potential.In the future, green hydrogen will be produced mainly where renewable energy is available at low cost. To transport it to the places where it’s needed, a transport medium is required: hashtag#ammonia. thyssenkrupp Uhde is one of the global technology leaders in ammonia cracking and the construction of green ammonia plants.Besides other industries, hashtag#cement production is one of the biggest levers for reducing emissions. With their innovative technologies thyssenkrupp Polysius is one of the pioneers for the climate-neutral transformation of the cement industry.

We all have a sense by now that the investment challenge is tremendous. But the CAPEX story is not the whole story. It’s also an OPEX challenge to secure the digital solutions, equipment and workforce we sorely need. I can speak from personal experience: at E.ON alone we will need to make 1 connection every 7 seconds of every working hour by 2030. This calls for new approaches in regulation, but also in planning, permitting, cooperation and engagement with local communities.  This was the central message I gave as Eurelectric President at yesterday’s High Level Grids Conference organized by ENTSO-E in Brussels, which brought together industry, regulators and policymakers from across Europe to help forge the way forward.  From my perspective there are three key actions that the EU can now take forward:- A bold European political drive: a new European project to supercharge investment in electricity grids must be agreed at high level by European political leaders. Commissioner Simson and Vicepresident Ribera’s strong show of commitment yesterday was a brilliant start. It’s time to build on this momentum. - New regulatory approaches are a must. For grid assets to be built ahead of new generation or demand, we need more clarity and certainty about the treatment of anticipatory investments. When it comes to operational expenses, like for digitalization and personnel, we must be allowed to adapt more flexibly to the massive task. And obviously regulation must reflect realities of financial markets and provide adequate returns.- Reframe the “toothpaste” discussion. It’s not flexibility versus expansion, but flexibility AND expansion. Yes, we need to squeeze out the most capacity out of existing grids (like a tube of toothpaste, obviously), but we also just need to buy more tubes of toothpaste. In remote areas, where there’s virtually no consumption but a lot of RES injection, we will have to completely transform the grid.  Time is running already. Grid capacity is not an issue of the future but is prevalent now and critical to hitting our 2030 targets. At E.ON and in Eurelectric we continue working to deliver this positive agenda.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7105935919525851136

If correct, it argues for keeping the AC on for as little as possible.My calculation:The ACs at my home are 1.5 tons, which (coincidentally) run at about 1.5 kilowatt of energy. That’s 1.5 kilowatt hour every hour, of course.The amount of CO2 per kilowatt hour depends on how green the electricity production and transmission is but varies between 0.4-1 kg CO2. In India, it is closer to 1. So let’s say a 1.5 kWh AC usage generates 1.5 kg CO2 every hour.A grown tree absorbs 70 grams of CO2 in a day, by some estimates.The AC running all day is generating 1.5x24=36 kilos of CO2 in a day.So you need 36,000/70 or over 500 fully grown trees to support your AC habit!And that’s just one AC.hashtag#ClimateEmergency",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7103947021182468097

What I wish to pass on to the aspiring leaders: 👉 We live in a very dynamic VUCA environment. One cannot rely only on conventional predictions based on strong signals from big or smart data.👉 Weak signals are becoming more and more important. Weak signals are qualitative, ambiguous, and intuitive signals. They are early signs of possible changes that may become significant later and trigger a meaningful trend.👉 As leaders, we need a broad picture to make the right decisions. A culture of hashtag#transparency, hashtag#engagement, hashtag#collaboration based on hashtag#trust encourages employees to speak up and put forward arguments based on weak signals.👉 A decentralised organisation and a focus on relative performance also help companies to identify weak signals and outperform in a complex VUCA world.Thanks to all students for the exchange.

In our conversation we covered the most important topics of European energy policy. I made clear once again that last year Europe navigated successfully through an energy crisis of historical proportions, but now faces tectonic shifts: new geopolitics, trade tensions and aggressive industrial policies, all with huge implications for the power sector. Therefore, as President of Eurelectric, I will focus my mandate on three key priorities: - Re-think security of supply, with large scale electrification at the core. Security of supply is a complex puzzle to future-proof Europe’s energy system against external shocks. - Deliver grids for speed. It’s welcome that transmission and distribution lines are higher on the agenda in Brussels. - Foster a market framework rooted in fairness. We will need a new set of long-term market mechanisms and de-risking instruments. The risks and benefits need to be equitably shared between investors, consumers and – where needed – member states. Generally, we need an aggressive delivery agenda across the EU. Investors must see some stability, simplicity and uniform implementation in national legislation.

Mental health is a case in point.  Science and society have made great progress in understanding and treating mental health. Socially, what was once a taboo subject is increasingly approached with understanding and transparency. More people today can feel free to seek mental health help without risking their education, job, or social status. This is progress.  But mental health, or lack of it, continues to negatively impact all areas of society, from family and relationships to school and work. The emotional and financial toll is enormous. According to the World Health Organization, two of the most common mental health conditions, depression and anxiety, cost the global economy US$1 trillion each year. Employers have an economic reason to focus on mental health and the workplace is naturally integral in helping to address it. An Edelman Trust Barometer Special Report “Trust and Health,” found that 91% of people surveyed consider mental health a crucial part of overall health, and 79% expect their employer to play a significant role in ensuring their overall well-being. The report reveals that employers are the only non-health institutions trusted with health, among those surveyed. In short, companies are seen as necessary to their employees’ well-being, and they’re stepping up.  The workplace has the power to be transformative in how society addresses mental health, helping to remove stigma, create safe environments, and offer supportive resources. Allianz recognizes the importance of a healthy workforce, not only for individual well-being but also for business success. We’ve introduced a range of new programs and initiatives aimed at supporting the mental, physical, social, and communal aspects of health for our employees, so that we can navigate life’s challenges and thrive. We don’t have all the answers and we’re still learning. Just acknowledging how mental health impacts our personal and collective well-being and productivity is a good start to making our homes, workplaces, and communities stronger.  #Allianz #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek #AllianzCares",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7100452446086287360

He explores the question, why cynicism is such a threat to corporate culture. That's why I invited him to my ""Expect the Unexpected"" format. In my view, four things are early warning signs:👉 Micromanagement and complex structures. They are incentives for people to behave politically in order to get ahead.👉 People stop sharing their knowledge.👉 Colleagues no longer support each other. They put their own well-being above that of the company.👉 Leaders lack empathy and emotional intelligence. The echo from their teams is cynicism. I firmly believe that cynicism has a hard time in the company if we set the right course:👉 Leaders must model trust and thus give cynicism no chance: a culture of trust is crucial. 👉 It starts at the top: the board must be a team. We have a common target for the board.👉 Success is only possible as a team and accordingly we must incentivize team performance.👉 Create transparency about your cultural development.👉 Recognize the early warning signs.

Sadly, we have also witnessed a series of disastrous wildfires in various countries across the globe in recent weeks causing widespread damage and sorrow.  An initial “back of the envelope” estimate of the economic impact by Allianz Research indicates that the recent heatwaves across the United States, Southern Europe, and China might have incurred a 0.6pp reduction in the GDP for 2023. Initial conclusions unveil that a single day of extreme heat with temperatures exceeding 32 degrees is equivalent to half a day of strike. You can delve into the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eGzMS3gF  While many wildfires occur naturally, the escalating dryness and unprecedented heat are causing them to happen more frequently and inflict greater destruction. As scientists have long predicted, these fires directly stem from climate change, and are driven by the global reliance on carbon-producing fossil fuels. Water stress is another consequence of climate change that scientists warned about, in the form of both water scarcity and dangerous abundance. Droughts and severe floods are now simultaneously more common, frequent, and devastating. More communities see their wells run dry, while others witness their towns float away, as experienced just recently in Slovenia. The scientific evidence is clear and points to the need for action on multiple fronts. Whether it’s fighting wildfires or managing water resources, the energy sector holds the key to mitigating the worst impacts of climate change. Replacing polluting coal, gas, and oil-fired power sources with renewal energy options significantly reduces carbon emissions.  At Allianz, we express our confidence in a safer and healthier tomorrow through action. Our expertise, partnerships, and investment approach actively drive decarbonization and climate resilience around the world. A recent example is our investment in Norwegian green ammonia production plants with Fuella. This investment demonstrates our confidence in green ammonia as a crucial contributor to the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Everyone has a role to play in this transition. But as one of the world’s biggest insurer, asset manager and investor, Allianz has a distinct responsibility to lead the way, both in our operations and in supporting our customers on their own journey towards sustainability.  As global leaders convene for the upcoming G20 summit and COP28 conference, I am eager to see the dialogue be matched with tangible action towards a more sustainable, resilient, and prosperous future.  #Allianz #EnergyTransition #COP28 #AllianzOnClimate",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7096820820533989376

As a CEO, knowing my employees are healthy is a priority. And yet, the rising cost of living, particularly for healthcare expenses, can make maintaining a healthy lifestyle challenging for many people today. In times of financial strain and stress, companies can play a particularly critical healthcare role, supporting the well-being of employees and their families. According to the “Trust and Health” report from the Edelman Trust Barometer Special Report, 79% of respondents expect their employer to play a significant role in ensuring their overall health. Additionally, when making purchasing decisions, 64% of respondents consider how a company’s brand, its products, and its business practices impact people’s health. These findings validate the link between employee well-being and a company’s overall health.  Prioritizing health empowers individuals and companies alike with the resilience needed to confidently face our often harsh and increasingly complex world. Mental health is foundational for both individual and societal growth and security. This is why at Allianz we emphasize health and well-being by providing resources, tools and support to our employees and customers. And the good news is that technology makes these resources more easily accessible, like with the Allianz Care Counseling videos, our Mental Wellbeing App, and our Expat Assistance Program. Benefits like these, however, are only good if they are used. Even the most committed employers can’t force their employees to watch over their health and wellness. Individual motivation is also necessary for a healthy lifestyle. Leaders of both big and small organizations can motivate employees by modeling wellness behaviors themselves and making health information and useful resources accessible. Prioritizing health isn’t about perfection. It often starts with establishing one or two healthy habits, as demonstrated in this video. Even small steps can create a positive ripple effect in the workplace, which in turn fosters creativity, innovation, and collaboration.   How do you prioritize your health when under pressure, or short on time?

There are legitimate concerns about the rapid evolution of AI capabilities and it's without doubt crucial to establish a common EU regulatory framework to address these. At the same time, however, it's also critical that the new Act does not stifle AI innovation and the key role this will play in Europe's competitiveness. Building trust around AI also goes beyond pure regulation. Now is the right time to proactively embrace a global AI Code of Conduct as proposed by the EU-US Trade and Technology Council and the G7. Such a code could guide businesses and their leaders in developing responsible AI practices. I believe in the power of global collaboration and welcome and support initiatives to harmonize AI policies at a global level, reinforcing an international commitment to #EthicalAI, #transparency, and #accountability.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7090345999059021824
Oliver Bäte,2023-07-27 07:25:54,Text + Photo,post,post,878,25,35,"Financial literacy is one of the most important skills needed in life. Simply put, financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use personal financial skills, including budgeting, managing risk, and investing. With it comes the knowledge needed for a lifelong positive relationship with money. In what can be a stressful world, financial literacy helps reduce uncertainty and enables confidence. And, especially in today’s inflationary times, financial literacy empowers people to better manage their money so that it goes further toward improving their quality of life.  Conversely, the lack of financial literacy has a negative ripple effect on individuals and families. A new Allianz report surveying more than 7,000 respondents across seven countries found that low financial literacy is costing households thousands every year. The study found that people with even basic financial literacy could earn up €1,750 more per year, whereas people with strong financial literacy could achieve an extra investment income of up to €5,000 per household. 1 in 4 survey respondents have low financial literacy, with women being more likely to exhibit low financial literacy than men. 46 % of men feel confident about their financial knowledge while only 33 % of women feel the same.  These findings underscore that the opportunity and obligation to help all people, but especially women, to become more financially confident. And there’s a lot we can do to address it, and this is why I am pleased to announce our new online Financial Literacy Hub. It’s designed to help fill the financial literacy gap and build confidence for everyone. In our new Hub, people can find useful information, interactive budgeting tools, and even register for free coaching from Allianz experts.  We also launched The Squared Ball, a new financial coaching program tailored to female football professionals. Why? Because our research found that women in professional football experience acute financial uncertainty. With The Squared Ball program, we’re shining a light on these challenges and offering tools to overcome them.  Financial literacy is not a luxury for the few, but a necessity for all of us. Each financially literate person is an empowered individual with the capabilities to make better financial decisions, which in turn often positively impact others in their families and communities. It strengthens their contribution to the economy, and in turn, supports economic growth and financial stability.

Without speaking the same language, innovation becomes difficult and decisive opportunities are missed. Currently, there is a lack of coherence in the discussion. This prevents policymakers from understanding the rapid pace of technology and its implications. Misunderstanding key technologies can lead to surprises, confusion, and strained relationships. Against this backdrop, the Security and Innovation Board of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), led by Christoph Heusgen and myself, decided to launch the MSC Summer School. The goal: to bridge the gap by bringing together policymakers and industry experts, fostering relationships and improving exchange. The start is done: For three days in our innovation center in Berlin, a team of exceptional talents discussed with experts from industry, science, business, and the German Federal Armed Forces what concrete steps are needed to overcome the silence. Next stop: Brussels. At the beginning of September, the team will present its findings to the Innovation Board. Many thanks to the great team from Accenture Europe, McKinsey, Google, Munich Security Conference, Westnetz, Silverado Policy Accelerator, Lockheed Martin, adarga ai, and Siemens Energy for their willingness to take on this important task.

After graduating in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Wolfgang started his career in Siemens in 1986 at Corporate Technology. In the 90s, he worked on a technology that revolutionized our communication options: being reachable from any location – with the mobile phone. ""Handys"" from Siemens, as they are called in Denglish, were very successful at the time; Wolfgang was Head of the development department. When I got my first mobile phone, Wolfgang was already CEO of the Industry Business of Siemens Nixdorf (1997-2001). Almost a quarter of a century ago, he joined #SiemensHealthineers, and there are not many managers who shaped and impacted the company as much as he did. His method: passion, persistence, and pioneering spirit. With these three, he managed what normally is deemed impossible: he led and shaped our Customer Services team for incredible 23 years! With a contagious passion to serve customers – 24/7, worldwide, onsite and online, to ensure that medical equipment is up and running and that medical staff has up-to-date knowledge. With persistence: Wolfgang never deviated from his principles of what a great service organization looks like and from his core beliefs of good management. He made his point consistently, and step by step created a world-class service team advocating for their needs in a culture in which often the leading innovators or the best sales guys get the credit – and the funding. And with a pioneering spirit: Wolfgang kept pushing, reinventing, questioning the status quo as if he had just taken over the role from someone else.Dear Wolfgang, I am in awe of your achievement. Thank you for all you have done for our customers and for Siemens Healthineers. Thank you for your passion, your persistence, and your pioneering spirit. And also for your objections!

This success story began in the late 1970s in a wooden hut at Siemens in Erlangen, which was built without any iron nails to avoid interference with the magnetic field during the first experiments. Despite many challenges and setbacks, the pioneers in this hut never lost their determination to push the boundaries of research. Although they were a small part of a big corporation, they kept a mindset like a start-up and were able to act like one. They are not only to thank for one of our most successful businesses, but also for one of the most vivid examples of our purpose: We pioneer breakthroughs in #healthcare, for everyone, everywhere. Finally, the team pioneered by introducing MAGNETOM GBS 1, our first commercial MRI system and a breakthrough in medical imaging.

Inner confidence is the reason why a humble person is not afraid to ask questions - because that is part of growing.There are different ways to work on a humble mindset and to grow:👉 Be honest with yourself. Admitting your weaknesses will show you where you can still grow. 👉 Don't put yourself first. A star team is more important than a star in the team.👉 Listen actively.

For over 70 years, Keadby provided electricity into the grid using coal. Today with Keadby 2, we officially opened the most efficient gas-fired power station in the world, producing almost two and a half times more electricity than its predecessor. By being able to ramp up in just 30 minutes, it can provide the UK's power system with the flexibility it requires. Keadby 2 generates enough electricity to power 840,000 homes while reducing CO2 emissions by 63,000 tonnes annually. That is nearly three times the carbon footprint of Lincolnshire or the equivalent of five million trees. The entire project was only possible thanks to a strong partnership with our partner SSE plc. I look forward to the next milestone projects we will tackle together. #energytransition #decarbonization #innovation",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7085284384353742850

We face two simultaneous global emergencies – climate change and the refugee crisis – plus geopolitical and economic instability, social polarization, and racial and gender inequalities. Not all these challenges are new. Some have been part of our lives for a long time, and we can learn from past mistakes and lessons. What is new is how these challenges are merging to test the strength of our social fabric.  The world desperately needs a new generation of problem solvers and fresh thinkers – and this is where new graduates come in and can play a differentiating role. The good news is that the graduates entering today’s workforce aren’t settling for the status quo. With all the world’s challenges, it’s also an exciting time, full of opportunities to make a positive impact.  Today’s younger generation has already demonstrated a profound understanding of the importance of taking action to secure the future. 70% of Gen Z is actively involved in social or political causes, according to a recent Edelman study. They refuse to sit on the sidelines, instead mobilizing people around the issues that matter to them. They view a successful career path as one that makes a positive impact on the world. Gen Z’s concern for humanity and sense of responsibility for the planet fills me with hope. If I can offer one piece of advice, it would be to encourage these young people to embrace uncertainty and see challenges as unlocked opportunities. Having spent my own career in insurance and risk management, I am trained to look at challenges as opportunities. In our business, we don’t run away from risks, we manage them as opportunities. I love this about our industry. It has helped me to develop a growth mindset and become comfortable with the uncomfortable.   Graduating and entering the workforce is always a time of uncertainty. But one thing is certain: the world needs you. The world needs experts, makers, and storytellers with new ways of looking at our old problems.  We need innovators, resilience builders and healthcare providers. Most of all we need people with a growth mindset, who aren’t seeking perfection but can clearly see an opportunity in every challenge.  Whatever you choose, remember that the world needs your skills and new perspectives. I invite you to explore the opportunities available at Allianz as you choose your path and look for a way to make a positive difference in the world: we will cheer you on. #Graduates #BetterTogether #Allianz",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7085171694562066432

Only a few years ago, the chlorine-alkali electrolysis was kind of an “enchanted princess” – barely anybody in the group saw the potential of this technology. We are lucky, some did.

This is the reason: Many years ago, I was offered a position as a CEO in Slovakia. I could have worked either from an office located in Vienna or directly from the Headquarters in Bratislava. Vienna was less then an hour away from Bratislava, but it wouldn’t have been an interesting change. Because we were curious about the people and the culture in Bratislava, my family and I decided to move there. The following years were an enriching challenge. Our curiosity was worthwhile – for our personal growth and for the success of the company.My personal story is only one small example for curiosity being the number one future skill. Companies face nowadays an ever-changing complex VUCA world. They can only adapt by constantly innovating and challenging the status quo. This is possible if employees stay curious, grow personally, and help the company to grow. Leaders play a crucial role in a culture of curiosity within an organisation. Here are some tips how to nurture curiosity:👉 As a leader be a role model for curiosity and stay open to change.👉 Ask smart, strategic, thoughtful, and targeted questions.👉 Listen actively and build trusting relationships with employees.👉 Empower employees to share own ideas and perspectives and reward creativity. 👉 Let employees explore and broaden their interests.👉 Hire for a curious mindset.Kudos to Bernard Marr for highlighting the importance of curiosity for success in his best-selling book on future skills.

It was the time when Bon Jovi and Depeche Mode filled the stadiums, when Roger Moore, alias James Bond, defended the good guys against the bad in Octopussy. I wasn't allowed to watch the film in the cinema – I was in the 8th grade at the grammar school in Ottobrunn. At that time, in 1983, Ragavan Dhandapany began his professional career in the medical division of Siemens AG UB Med – as Siemens Healthineers was then called. Step by step, his career progressed until he finally took overall responsibility for our business in India in 2005. It was during this year that we met in person for the first time – and immediately realized that we had different opinions:Ragavan: ""𝐌𝐫. 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠, 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐨𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦'𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐬"". Me, then the new head of CT: “𝐌𝐫. 𝐑𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐧, 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐞𝐬"". What seemed to me to be a particularly smart reply quickly emerged as complete ignorance of the situation on site, which he explained to me – typical Ragavan – objectively, calmly and without yielding an inch. He made it clear that our pace of innovation could quickly devalue clients' investments, potentially turning one of our key strengths into a problem. The message behind it: there are neither one-dimensional problems nor one-dimensional solutions. If you are sure of something, take a moment to doubt it. Ragavan opened my eyes to seeing the challenges of different healthcare systems from the customer's point of view. And he has never stopped. I am very grateful for that! I am grateful that he is a combative spirit in the best sense of the word, who is never concerned with clumsy dogmatism, but always with the matter at hand and the better, clearer argument. I admire him for constantly reinventing himself in his various roles. After nine years as head of our business in India, he moved to Germany as head of global sales for CT. Today he is responsible for our global CRM activities. He remains curious and always brings a fresh perspective. He always asks the right (tricky) questions and manages to match the customer's external perspective with our internal perspective and to come up with solutions. I have great respect for his deep spirituality as a devout Hindu. I remember many a philosophical conversation. Me: ""𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐝𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐧𝐞 '𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬' 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐚𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐬?""

On the one hand, the ""playing human being"". Who is curious about new things. And who playfully opens up new worlds. Tries things out. Experiments. And in the end: becomes creative. But: also gives the ""game"" rules. I often experience this when I meet startups. Or in countries where these startups are successful. This is made possible by a vision of humanity that gives companies and their founders the freedom to operate as ""homo ludens"".In contrast, there is an image of man in which man is a wolf to man. With the consequence of wanting to ""contain"" and ""civilize"" people accordingly. By regulation. One anticipates all possible risks in advance and tries to minimize them. With the side effect that the creative gets lost. Or is created elsewhere. Unfortunately, this often happens to us in Europe.We are currently experiencing this with the topic of #AI. We all know: AI holds incredible opportunities. And yes, there are risks, too. The EU wants to address these with planned legislation. I think the idea is right. But maybe it's the wrong way to go about it? Because what will happen? We will disadvantage local companies that are active in the AI environment. In the end, their compliance department may have to be larger than the actual development department, because various regulations have to be met and checked. What will these companies do? They will look for a new home where they can operate as ""homo ludens"".Now I am not a friend of organized or unorganized irresponsibility. Recently, in a lecture, I heard the sentence: Everything that can be weaponized, will be weaponized. That is true.So I think the right way is for Europe not to create anticipatory regulation, but to enter into a community of responsibility with those whose values we share. That is, our partners like the United States. We need to create a transatlantic framework when it comes to AI. And with that, a level playing field there and here in Europe. A competition that is there for the people. And one that protects the cohesion of our society(s).That's why I was happy to sign a letter together with several entrepreneurs and companies asking the EU to revise its planned AI legislation.

Wouldn't it be better to talk about how we put young people in charge and encourage them to get involved in our companies than to go on and on about the pros and cons of the home office?

Wouldn't it make sense to actively address sustainability instead of always having fundamental debates about long-settled climate change issues? And to use AI in a human-centric way instead of always starting the same technology debates all over again?I see the questions of our time as challenges that we can actively address. For instance, by truly creating a Europe, rather than being on the road with 27 Europes that don't form a digital single market. For example, by reducing bureaucracy and transferring the ""German speed"" of LNG terminals to other areas such as mobile phone masts.

I understand that the mass balancing approach may seem distant or irrelevant to some. But it's a principle that holds the key to our #FullyCircular future. Mass balancing is not just a distant promise – it's an immediate, tangible step towards sustainability, one that doesn't require waiting for extensive availability of alternative raw materials or entirely new production sites. As leaders in our fields, we must challenge misinformation and oversimplification with respect, fact-based dialogue, and understanding. If you're already familiar with mass balancing, I invite you to help make it more accessible to those who aren't. Our journey towards a #CircularEconomy needs every voice, every perspective.

In other words: If AI is the material, SAP is the tailor. Business AI will completely change the way companies interact with our software, revolutionizing the business world. Today, users pull reports on finances, suppliers, materials, employees, and sustainability. As AI advances, people will be able to ask their systems questions such as ""how can I reduce my company's carbon footprint in the next few years while also maintaining the same level of profit?"" Similarly, the system will be able to make smart recommendations on how to become more productive and efficient and drive its own automation and configuration. In short, at SAP, we firmly believe that generative AI will fundamentally change the way people and software work together and we're excited about the opportunities this brings.https://lnkd.in/esWEVmF9 (German)",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7079833410420006912

And during the pandemic, some said, there were 80 million virologists. Of course, these are all tongue-in-cheek exaggerations, but there’s a bit of truth to them: The pandemic raised our #curiosity to learn more about how the world of viruses and bacteria works, how hygiene protects us from infection – and what happens in our bodies when they must defend themselves against outside invaders. I was very happy when I came across this (audio) book by Philipp Dettmer: In “Immune: A Journey into the Mysterious System That Keeps You Alive” Dettmer explains in a very entertaining and fascinating way how our highly complex immune system functions, and which highly specialized players come into action – both on “our” side and on the enemy’s side.“Immunology meets the masses,” writes the renowned Science Magazine about the #book. I gladly subscribe to this review, because I learned a lot about #immunology, which is a constant matter in everyone’s life. The most fascinating fact is how our body can balance swiftly fighting off infections and being appropriately aggressive to avoid harming ourselves. Reading Dettmer’s book inspired me to pay more attention to my body’s needs and be more mindful of its workings.

I am proud of the commitment shown by #Allianz in creating an open and diverse culture that nurtures our talent and provides an environment free from discrimination. However, there is still much progress to be made on a global scale. As Pride Month and Christopher Street Day (CSD) are celebrated worldwide, it is important to pause and reflect on the importance of recognizing and supporting the LGBTQ+ community. In many regions, this community faces challenges to their freedoms. It is crucial to protect and reinforce the right to live freely without fear, and with equality under the law. This is a fundamental human right. Pride Month and CSD parades serve as reminders of importance of safety and equality for the LGBTQ+ community. These events also provide an opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of LGBTQ+ individuals and their contributions to our society as a whole. At Allianz, our aim is to embrace equality every day by creating an inclusive environment where all employees are valued, treated with dignity, enjoy their work, and can freely express their authentic selves. We have an active and growing LGBTQ+ community, which includes our Allianz Pride employee network, consisting of 27 local chapters all around the world. As signatories of the UN Free & Equal LGBTI Standards of Conduct, we pledge our support for an inclusive environment for our customers, employees, and communities. Additionally, we actively encourage and celebrate LGBTQ+ representation in leadership positions. I’m proud of Marie-Helene Tyack, Chair of the Allianz Global Pride Board, who was recently recognized as the 2023 Inspirational Role Model of the Year in The Bank of London Rainbow Honours. Each of us has a vital role to play in rejecting discrimination and developing a workplace where everyone feels valued and respected. Let us carry the spirit of Pride Month throughout the year, because it takes all of us, every day, to defend freedom of self-expression and to call out and resolve injustices when they occur. As we encourage inclusive ways of working and empower all colleagues to succeed as their authentic selves, we each help create an environment where all employees can thrive. This positions us for success to serve our customers in an ever-evolving world.Learn more about our commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion here: https://lnkd.in/e6ERpTqM#AllianzPride #GetReadyForTheBest #CSD #Pride #DiversityShinesBright #InclusiveWorkplace",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7078285023249879040

And who would be better to feel the pulse of these arteries than Allianz Trade, the world leader in Trade Credit Insurance? To gain insights into the current state of global trade today, the recently published 2023 Allianz Trade Global Survey surveyed about 3,000 companies in seven countries: France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the US. In general, exporters maintain a cautious sense of optimism, with around 70% of businesses expecting an increase in export generated turnover in 2023. However, challenges and risks, including non-payment concerns, continue to dominate priorities. As a result, ESG initiatives have taken a backseat, with 80% of respondents prioritizing business continuity over ESG commitments this year. Fortunately, it’s not a binary choice. Organizations can prioritize both business continuity and ESG goals without facing inherent conflicts. This is evident by the fact that 85% of respondents are actively dedicated to a long-term energy transition. This raises the question: How can we foster robust trade, which plays a vital role in the global economy, while minimizing environmental impact and achieving emissions targets outlined in the Paris Agreement?The new report provides insights into addressing this question. Personally, I find it encouraging that an overwhelming majority of respondents support a long-term energy transition, validating that we don’t have to make a choice between economic growth, sustainable development, and social welfare. Trade has long played a significant role in our society, and it can be a valuable tool for creating a more prosperous, resilient, and equitable world.Explore the full report here: https://lnkd.in/e2-UUQR4 #AllianzTradeGlobalSurvey2023 #Trade #SustainableDevelopment #ESG #Allianz",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7075034733302165505

This is not only attributed to healthy lifestyle but also to Japan's advanced #healthcare system. Nevertheless, Japan faces the same challenges as many other industrialized nations: aging population, increase in chronic illnesses, and shortage of medical and nursing professionals. It’s just admirable how Japan embraces #technology and #innovation to tackle these challenges. During the past three days, I had the great pleasure and honor to talk with many Japanese customers and partners about these exact questions. What can Siemens Healthineers contribute to making healthcare in Japan more accurate, efficient, and accessible?  I was especially happy about seeing Dr. Yoshiaki Sagara again, Chairman of Sagara Hospital, our long-standing partner and one of the leading hospitals pioneering the future of women’s health in Japan. Nine years after our first meeting when he presented his vision it was so impressive to see how his hospitals have developed and how they grow and stand out – but I also smiled when I thought about how we have developed as a company and partner at the same time. Long-term relationships like this are very fulfilling and it is so nice to see them flourish. And of course, I also took the opportunity to visit our team in Tokyo – and to do a (partially virtual) town hall meeting.

Oliver Bäte,2023-06-13 11:00:31,Text + Video,post,post,1076,7,44,"Studying the past often provides solutions for the future. Hydrogen, the power source behind the first internal combustion engine in the 1860s, is now being rediscovered as an alternative fuel in the face of climate change.There is great potential for hydrogen to fuel long-haul trucks and ships using fuel cells, as well as supporting electrical power grids to meet the energy demands of homes and industries on a large scale. The decreasing costs of renewable electricity has sparked interest in producing hydrogen through electrolyzers, which are devices that utilize electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. When renewable sources power this electricity process, the resulting hydrogen is considered ‘green’ since it produces harmless water vapor instead of greenhouse gases (GHGs). How much does this have to do with the insurance sector and Allianz? I am proud to say quite a bit actually. Investments made by the insurance industry can play a pivotal role in achieving a green hydro-based economy. As asset owners, insurance companies possess the long-term investment horizon that makes them an ideal source of infrastructure financing. At Allianz, we are actively developing both parts needed to produce green hydrogen, renewable energy and electrolyzers. For nearly two decades, Allianz has been investing in renewable energy sources like solar PV and wind farms. We have recently made direct investments in Ren-Gas, a Finnish green hydrogen and power-to-gas developer. Additionally, three years ago, Allianz, together with other institutional investors, acquired a 75% stake in the gas distribution operator Floene, which supports the national energy transition plan of Portugal.In addition to investing as asset owners, insurers also provide the necessary insurance coverage needed for hydrogen and renewable energy projects. As long-term risk managers, insurers are a natural fit for supporting the transition away from fossil fuel dependency and towards clean, renewable energy. These are exciting times for our industry. Working with our partners in government, insurers are playing a major role in transitioning our global society towards an energy system that is more environmentally clean, healthy, affordable and secure.

The second offer promised none of that but a big challenge. I opted for the second alternative. Why? Because the job gave me the freedom to shape the future of the company and to develop my skills. The jump into the deep end had triggered a huge amount of energy. Had I done things wrong along the way? Yes! But for me, that was part of the learning process. I was soon given a new challenging task where I could continue to grow. This experience had a lasting effect on my professional career.Psychologist Carol Dweck argues in her groundbreaking book ""Mindset: The New Psychology of Success"" that success is not due to hashtag#intelligence, hashtag#talent or hashtag#education, but to a hashtag#growthmindset. People with a growth mindset believe that success comes from constant personal development and hard work. They are hashtag#curious and accept challenges easily. This contrasts with people with a fixed mindset, who believe that they are limited by fixed, innate talents that cannot be changed or improved. They fear challenges. The good news is that a growth mindset can be learned!Here is how you can cultivate a growth mindset:👉 Discover where you currently are on the spectrum between growth mindset and fixed mindset.👉 Stay curious. Try to see challenges and failures as opportunities for self-development. 👉 Reward yourself for hard work. 👉 Embrace the power of ""YET"", such as ""I don't know how to do this YET"". 👉 Be mindful of how you think about others' work. Instead of saying, ""She's talented,"" you could say, ""She worked hard to develop this skill."" 👉 Be patient. Getting there is part of the journey.In line with our hashtag#Talanx purpose `Together we take care of the unexpected and foster entrepreneurship`, an entrepreneurial growth mindset is part of our DNA. Accordingly, people development is an essential part of our corporate strategy. Especially in a challenging VUCA-world we need an absolute growth mindset!

V. diskutierte ich mit Vertreterinnen und Vertretern aus der Entsorgungswirtschaft und Politik über unsere nationale Kreislaufwirtschaftsstrategie. Trotz unserer unterschiedlichen Branchen haben wir doch ein gemeinsames Ziel: Deutschland als attraktiven, nachhaltigen und zukunftsfähigen Industriestandort etablieren, und zwar durch die Schaffung einer #Kreislaufwirtschaft. Dieses gemeinsame Ziel kann und muss uns näherbringen. Denn die weltweit steigende Nachfrage nach Kunststoffen passt derzeit nicht zu den gerade einmal neun Prozent der Kunststoffabfälle, die recycelt werden. In Deutschland sind es immerhin 30 Prozent, doch die Luft nach oben ist ersichtlich. Dieser scheinbare Widerspruch kann in Wirklichkeit eine Chance sein. Durch den Einsatz recycelter Rohstoffe zur Deckung der Kunststoffnachfrage können wir sowohl unser Rohstoffproblem als auch unser Abfallproblem lösen. Dafür sind vor allem zwei Dinge entscheidend: - Innovationen beim Design und Recycling von Kunststoffen- Unterstützung durch politische und regulatorische Rahmenbedingungen An Ideen, Innovationen und dem nötigen Know-How fehlt es uns nicht. An schnell umsetzbaren, aufeinander abgestimmten Maßnahmen müssen wir dagegen noch schwer arbeiten. Keine leichte Aufgabe, aber auch kein Grund, sie auf die lange Bank zu schieben.

It was not only instructive, it was also fun to exchange ideas with so many innovative and successful entrepreneurs.Both industries need to continue to transform in order to remain successful. I was able to talk about this yesterday. There are many points to this, here are just a few:1. #Digitization and data use must be prioritized and scaled in all companies. This includes AI, it's the only way to manage ""Big Data"". API must be part of the DNA.2. technological sovereignty through own #KI like ADAS, battery production, chips.3. evolution from silos to partnerships. Learned OEM logic is sometimes too hierarchical.And the most important point: high competitive culture and ""winner mentality"". Don't get infected by defeatism. Instead, implement things with a clear focus. To do this, it is important to leave your own comfort zone. Because only beyond the comfort zone do we train ourselves and become more resilient, which in turn helps us to master problems and challenges. For me, this also includes the principle: ""Stay happy as a person"". A bird can only fly with two wings.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we distanced ourselves socially. Even though I met many people virtually, I missed the emotional qualities of face-to-face communication.

Today, not a day goes by that I am not engaging face-to-face with colleagues or business partners.Because of this personal experience, I am touched by a recent advisory published by US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy on the topic of hashtag#loneliness. In his opinion, a public health crisis is looming in the US due to the lack of social connection. Several studies show that this also applies to other societies.Loneliness is not just about a lack of connections in personal relationships.

Oliver Bäte,2023-05-19 09:01:54,Carousel,post,post,507,5,16,"Foresight is a key characteristic of a responsible insurance company. The recently released Allianz Global Insurance Report 2023 reveals that the global insurance industry has applied our skills for foresight to successfully navigate through challenging inflationary times and help our customers be more resilient. And yet, as outlined in the report, inflation continues to impact companies and customers alike. Price increases cause claims payments by insurers to rise sharply, tempering premium growth. Inflation has also led to a decline in real incomes forcing households to reduce their saving efforts – slowing life insurance market growth.  I share the viewpoint of my Allianz Research colleagues, who believe that structural drivers will determine inflation in the coming years. In this environment, insurers play a crucial role by acting as an economic shock absorber. Although the insurance industry cannot undo inflation, insurers can mitigate its impacts by safeguarding the assets of their customers and ensuring uninterrupted business operations. Insurers have the opportunity to strengthen our value proposition in this context. We can use our foresight to anticipate a shift in focus from merely covering risk to assisting customers in avoiding risk altogether. This is one of the reasons why we at Allianz are deeply committed to the transition toward a #netzero future. By addressing the effects of climate change, we help mitigate some of the most significant risks that our society, economy, and customers currently face. Leading the way towards a more sustainable and resilient economy is how we secure the future of our customers and the stability of our business. Learn more about the role that insurance plays in inflationary environments and gain insights into the forthcoming implications by reading the full report: https://lnkd.in/ePdxwguG #Allianz #Inflation #SustainableFinance #InsuranceReport2023",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7065250202575626241

Nine European countries pledged to increase offshore wind farm capacity in the North Sea by eight times the current levels, this was announced at a summit on offshore wind this April, in Ostend, Belgium. The aim is to boost their combined capacity to 120GW by 2030 and 300GW by 2050 and turn the North Sea into the “powerhouse of Europe”.  This pledge highlights the urgent need for renewable energy sources and the importance of collaboration between policymakers and the business community to accelerate investment in renewables and green energy infrastructure. Allianz takes great pride in playing a key role regarding investments in Europe’s renewable energy industry, which has developed into a well-established and sustainable business over the past 25 years. Allianz has long recognized wind power as a good, long-term value investment, and a source of stable, long-term cash yield profile with low risks. Our investment portfolio includes more than 100 wind farms and solar park projects in Europe, and the US, including some of the largest offshore wind farms in the world such as He Dreiht in Germany and Hollandse Kust Zuid in the Netherlands. These investments in wind and solar energy projects are instrumental in advancing the share of renewable energy in Europe, reinforcing our goal of achieving a carbon-neutral portfolio by 2050. The offshore wind ambitions of Europe are massive and meeting them requires substantial investments. At Allianz, we remain keen to support the transition to renewables, whether it’s through investment impact, or through partnerships such as the United Nations convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, where we champion ambitious decarbonization strategies that can be effectively implemented at scale. And a successful renewable energy transition requires diverse forms of collaboration between governments, industry, organizations, and individuals. That’s why this new pledge holds a great deal of promise. As the old saying goes, “If you want to go fast, go alone.

This is because the executives free up management positions, which we fill with young talents. This makes our management level younger and more diverse. At the same time, the transfer of knowledge is successful. Our experienced executives are well versed in how to put a good idea into practice. And they know not only Telekom but also the markets from years of experience. From successes and certainly also from mistakes. How valuable!My motto this year is: Get out of the comfort zone!The Executive Advisor team members have done just that. They are daring to do something new. They are shaping transformation by leaving familiar territory and taking a whole new path late in their careers. So they are taking on a whole new challenge - including, like all our advisors, an assessment center.For me, this is a building block for successful digitization. #digitalization #team #management #consulting Daniel Eckmann #careers",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7059055298774212608

I have made it clear that the European internal market for energy has benefited all European states in the energy crisis of last winter. Electricity from Germany has supported French power plants, Germany has benefited from French gas infrastructure, gas from Germany has been piped to Central and Eastern Europe. It is therefore a good thing that the European Union is opting for evolution rather than revolution in the upcoming energy market reforms. As President of Eurelectric, I am committed to ensuring that we provide as much market as possible and as much government guidance as necessary to ensure a secure and sustainable energy supply for citizens and the economy. But I also say: we need to work harder in Europe to be competitive with other economies.

This is the key message I took away from a workshop that is part of our hashtag#Talanx Leadership Journey. Around twenty leaders from various business units, including myself, shared our experiences on the topic “leading the transformation”.  Crises and external changes force companies to transform. hashtag#Transformation is no longer the exception. It is the rule. In times of permanent transformation, it is important to master hashtag#change projects fast and successfully.  But what are key success factors for change projects? I took the following insights from our workshop:  👉 There’s a big difference between change management and change leadership. A well-thought-out change plan and good change management alone are not enough. Understanding and addressing people's concerns in an empathetic way is crucial. This is what change leadership is about.👉 As change leaders, we are role models and should lead with a growth mindset. 👉 Communicating the ""Why"" and the ""What's in for me?"" is crucial. 👉 An emotional vision activates people to drive change. 👉 Active listening, a hashtag#feedback and error culture based on hashtag#trust are important.👉 To drive change, leaders need to empower their change agents and give them autonomy and responsibility. However, empowerment can only be successful if the leader consistently approaches people and acts as a sparring partner at eye level.👉 The opponents of change are usually louder. The supporters tend to be quiet. If they are given a voice, they can become pioneers of change and can activate the opponents.👉 Transformation is a marathon and needs a consistent, systemic anchoring of values such as hashtag#collaboration, hashtag#transparency and hashtag#engagement in our case.

Oliver Bäte,2023-04-28 09:09:40,Text + Photo,post,post,314,5,12,"Public pension debates have been hitting the headlines lately, and for good reason – the demographic clock is ticking loudly and there is a need in many countries for urgent reforms to reinforce and stabilize public pensions.  The case for pension reform is a key takeaway from the recently-released Allianz Global Pension Report 2023, which suggests that public pensions will continue to present policy challenges in both advanced and emerging economies in the years ahead.  That’s the bad news. The good news is that our analysis shows that many countries can reach a more sustainable and adequate pension system by implementing the right policies at the right time. The healthiest pension systems in the world have early established a roadmap for cushioning against the effects of demographic change, such as by implementing measures in terms of funding and contribution periods. This can serve as a useful example for other countries, particularly developing ones that have a bigger window of opportunity, but that still need to act as quickly as possible in order to reform their pension systems. While the debate over public pension reform continues among economic leaders and policymakers, it’s clear that governments can’t be expected to solve these pension challenges alone. The report also addresses how private pension products will play an increasingly important role in helping people fund their retirements. This is leading to an exciting period of public/private coordination and policy innovation.  The report also touches on another silver lining – how pensions fund managers are contributing to the growth in sustainable finance. An increasing number of pension funds have committed to the 1.5°C target of the Paris Climate Agreement. Associations such as the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), whose membership includes many of the world’s leading pension funds, are delivering on the bold commitment to transition their investment portfolios to net zero GHG emissions by 2050 with intermediate targets. NZAOA-members help pave the way in encouraging investors to allocate an ever-increasing share of their portfolios towards ESG products that support the shift towards a low-carbon economy.  As a founding member of the NZAOA, Allianz has been deeply involved in working with many of these pension fund investors. We’ve witnessed how their bold action helps secure pension funding while also leading investment into the transition economy. That’s what I call long-term stewardship, for a world in which we can all breathe a little easier.  Read the full report for other takeaways: https://lnkd.in/eJqnydJ3  #Allianz #Pension #PensionReform #Sustainability #SustainableFinance",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7057642011801079808

Less tangible, but no less important, are the “softer” impacts – namely, the impact financial stress can have on health and well-being. Newly-released data from the Edelman Trust Barometer Special Report: Trust and Health, found that inflation is the number one societal factor making us sick. The negative impacts aren’t just limited to our physical health; 9 out of 10 people said that mental health is a prerequisite for a healthy life. But as we all know, economic uncertainty can be profoundly stressful, putting our mental health at risk.  The good news is that there are ways to manage financial stress. Firstly, by getting support. Whether it’s friends, family, a trusted professional advisor or all three, few of us can manage financial stress alone. Like most things in life, it’s better, and often more satisfying, to solve challenges with the people we know and trust.  Financial preparation is also not a “once and done” exercise. Like maintaining our physical and mental health, it’s more an evolution of establishing healthy habits. Taking stock of one’s financial situation is a process that takes time. Identifying goals and gaining the financial literacy and advice on how to accomplish them is, however, achievable, especially when broken down into small, manageable steps. Believe me, we see this happen every day in our customers’ lives. The most important step, and often the hardest one, is taking the first step. But the feeling of being financially prepared is well worth it, especially for one’s mental outlook. Optimism isn’t magic, it’s the result of preparation.  Financial security – being aware of and in control of our money and debts, protected against risks/shocks and equipped to handle emergencies – is an ongoing preparation process.  Individuals can’t control inflation or broader cost of living trends, but we can control how we respond to them.

In Deutschland sind Investitionen, Exporte und das Wirtschaftswachstum allesamt verhalten. Sehen wir uns einmal an, wo deutsche Industrieunternehmen stattdessen investieren, wird das massive deutsche Standortproblem schnell ersichtlich. Anders als in den USA und China herrschen in Deutschland derzeit Bürokratie, hohe Energiekosten und Überregulierung par excellence. Statt die Rahmenbedingungen zu verbessern, tritt die Bundesregierung mit zusätzlichen Schranken im #Energieeffizienzgesetz aufs Bremspedal der industriellen Transformation. Die Konsequenzen der einsetzenden Deindustrialisierung stellen jeden Optimismus auf die Probe. Denn eine Abwanderung der Industrie bedeutet Wohlstandsverlust. Rund ein Viertel des deutschen BIP erwirtschaftet die Industrie.

Und ebenso fatal: Ohne die Industrie kann Deutschland seine Rolle als Innovationsmotor der globalen Nachhaltigkeitstransformation nicht erfüllen. Denn diese Transformation ist eng an eine starke Industrie gekoppelt, die nachhaltige Technologien für sie liefert. Wir haben eine wettbewerbsfähige Industrie ohne wettbewerbsfähige politische Rahmenbedingungen.

At first glance, the findings appear discouraging, with global insolvencies set to rise by 21% in 2023 and 4% in 2024. However, from my point of view, there is a silver lining. Despite the worrisome increase, global business insolvencies are projected to stay -5% below their pre-pandemic levels in 2023 and -1% in 2024. There are significant regional variations, of course, and it remains clear that lower economic growth in 2023 and 2024 will take its toll everywhere.  Times like this are when insurance is needed most: to act as a buffer against uncertainty and risk, and enable economic activities that could not – or would not – take place otherwise.  Overall, this year’s report emphasizes the importance of companies taking proactive steps to reduce their risks, such as managing their cash flow, developing contingency plans, and working with insurers to help protect against potential losses. While not a panacea, insurance can shield companies from interruptions to their business and help provide the financial safety net they need to protect their assets and avoid interruptions to their business – particularly in times of economic uncertainty.  Read the Global Insolvency Report here: https://lnkd.in/dEJRAdMd  #AllianzTrade #InsolvencyReport2023",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7054383508235984896

The most interesting points from my perspective:- Companies that are already using AI are benefiting significantly (e.g. cost decreases and revenue increases)- AI is both helping and harming the environment (e.g. it makes processes more energy efficient, but also requires energy itself)- The number of incidents concerning the misuse of AI is rapidly rising (e.g. deepfakes)- Interest in AI is increasing, not least among politicians and legislatorsFor me, the development and use of AI solutions go hand in hand with responsibility. This means, for example, thinking about sustainability when developing AI solutions, and focusing on the benefits for - and safety of - the people using it. Achieving this requires a careful balance between enabling technological process and establishing rules based on common values. After all, AI opens up a new way of doing business with entirely new business models. It can help make businesses more agile, supply chains more resilient, and economies more sustainable. I would like to see Europe focus on these opportunities. By overregulating out of fear of the potential risks, we also face the very real possibility of losing startups and investors, for example. In addition to the existing regulations that apply already, the upcoming EU AI Act should only regulate AI applications that pose significant risk to the health, safety, and fundamental rights of citizens. I hope that the vote in the European Parliament will not deviate from a risk-based approach. Finally, I would like to encourage governments to agree on global principles and standards for the use of safe and trustworthy AI.

Denn nachhaltig entwickeln wir bei der Telekom unser Geschäft. Das zeigt sich auch in der Aktie. Die Gesamtrendite im vergangenen Jahr: 18,6 Prozent. Ein gutes Ergebnis auch im Vergleich zum DAX, der im selben Zeitraum mit 12,4 Prozent im Minus lag. 70 Cent pro Aktie schütten wir als Dividende aus - steuerfrei.Wirtschaftlicher Erfolg ist die Basis dafür, dass wir auch unsere gesellschaftliche Verantwortung wahrnehmen können. Bis 2025 wollen wir klimaneutral sein, bis 2040 sogar entlang unserer gesamten Wertschöpfungskette: Von der Produktion von Endgeräten bis zum Stromverbrauch bei den Kundinnen und Kunden. Zugleich helfen wir, wenn wir gebraucht werden. Zuletzt beim Erdbeben in der Türkei und Syrien.

We at E.ON have clear messages on this, not only on our own behalf to represent our interests, but out of our responsibility to the economy and society. One thing is clear: E.ON is part of the solution on the path to transforming energy systems. That is why I repeatedly go public with our positions and make it clear where and what E.ON stands for and what we believe is the right thing to do - in Germany and Europe. In the last few days I have given a number of interviews. I will briefly report on three of them to give you an insight into this part of my ""job description"". At the beginning of March, I was a guest of the BBC World News television station and spoke there primarily about the issues that are important for Europe's security of supply and competitiveness: a modern market design and the massive expansion of the energy infrastructure, but also a non-bureaucratic approach to building a European hydrogen economy. So that the USA with its Inflation Reduction Act does not completely leave us behind in the international competition for capital and investments.  On the day of our successful annual press conference, I spoke live with Bloomberg. I explained our strong annual results compared to the turbulent business environment, but above all I outlined our growth and investment plans. Despite the turmoil in the European energy markets, we have achieved a 2022 result that is both above the previous year's level and above our own forecasts. Now we are expanding our investment programme to a total of 33 billion euros by 2027 on a solid financial and balance sheet foundation. This underpins our claim to be the driver and shaper of an accelerated energy transition in Europe.  Both interviews were exciting for me but also critical. The same was true for my Interview with the Handelsblatt which now is also published. My interview partners from the Handelsblatt, with whom I spoke last week, were also critical. The upcoming phase-out of nuclear energy was the main topic here. I made it clear here once again that we respect the political decisions to phase out nuclear power and will implement them professionally - even though our nuclear power plants have made a valuable contribution to security of supply and climate protection. We are now looking ahead. Because with our grids and customer solutions we have a very clear growth project: the energy transition in Europe! And we are also moving forward in the media.

As a world-leading manufacturer of hashtag#wind turbines, we at Siemens Gamesa – together with the entire hashtag#European wind industry – are managing the damage that was done years ago when the market for wind energy massively declined. Back then, Russian gas was the easiest option for policymakers and industry alike. As a result, suppliers in the wind industry went out of business, skilled people moved to other industries, and many thousands of people lost their jobs. More than one year into Germany's Zeitenwende (“turn of the times”), the wind of change is coming from all directions: initiatives, new acts, laws from Berlin, Brussels, Washington, and around the world. Calling the targets for wind expansion “ambitious” is an understatement. Within a few years, we need to pull off what we haven’t been able to do in previous decades. At Siemens Gamesa, we welcome this challenge. And we are transforming our business to transform our hashtag#energy systems.  But I also made the point yesterday that Europe’s wind industry needs more than ambitious targets. We need fundamental – and above all swift and decisive – change to be able to grow fast and deliver the wind turbines we need. Policy and decision makers on the European, national, and regional levels have more work to do. Among other tasks, they need to:  ➡  massively increase investments in manufacturing capacities and key infrastructure; ➡  accelerate permitting (around 80 gigawatts of wind energy projects are currently stuck in approval procedures across Europe – a big number compared with the 204 gigawatts of installed capacity);  ➡  implement the indexation of revenues defined in auctions for renewable energies to compensate for inflation; and ➡  avoid negative bidding, i.e. avoid expecting winning developers to pay for the right develop wind projects – a cost which is passed onto the supply chain and end consumers. The European wind industry is determined to do everything it can to achieve the targets of wind expansion. And we want to ensure that wind projects in Europe are also made in Europe. That is why we have no more time to lose. We have to get things done, and we have to get them done now. hashtag#MoreWindNow hashtag#WindEnergy hashtag#EnergySovereignty hashtag#EnergyPolicy hashtag#EnergyTransition hashtag#OffshoreWind hashtag#OnshoreWind",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7047552852939988992

For the first time in more than two decades the world counts more closed autocracies than liberal democracies, as highlighted by V-Dem Institute Democracy Report 2023. This correlates with a decline in government trust; according to the 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer, trust in governments has decreased by a percentage point over the last year, to just 50% of people worldwide – compared to 59% trust in NGOs and 62% trust in businesses.  Democracy remains the best system available to humanity for unleashing our potential, promoting international peace and security, growing prosperity, and upholding human dignity, particularly in times of uncertainty and rapid change. The responsibility of preserving democracy does not fall solely on governments as the private sector also plays an important role as one of the world’s most trusted institutions.  Fortunately, there are many ways in which businesses can help to promote democratic values. At Allianz, we aim to support one of the key pillars of democracy, namely a stable and growing middle class by protecting our customers against economic shocks and helping them secure their financial future.

We have the ability to help mitigate the effects of inflation for both consumers and the wider economy.  There are several management actions insurers can take to respond to inflation, beginning with customer communication, and including product innovation, investment in technology and digitalization, strategic partnerships, and diversification of investments. At Allianz, we have added inflation clauses to policies, worked with customers to update their sum insured data, and applied external inflation benchmarks where possible. Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS) works with clients and brokers to update asset values and ensure clients have appropriate cover that is accurately priced. Incorporating an indexation feature in insurance policies, for instance, ensures that the policy benefits keep up with the rising costs of living and inflation. On the investment side, we’ve increased allocations to inflation-linked bonds, providing additional protection in case inflation persists. While we can’t control inflation, we can help cushion its blow by putting customer needs at the forefront and helping to secure their future by preserving their assets.  Learn more about our approach here:  https://lnkd.in/e-yvjZmy #AllianzOnCostofLiving #Inflation",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7045002504224333825

If we continue as before, our chances of achieving our climate goal are 'very low.' Despite this bleak reality, I am confident that we can turn things around. We already know exactly what needs to be done. We know that we need to prioritize renewable energies and alternative raw materials, and we have a clear understanding of how much and where to source them. We know that until enough renewable energies and resources are available, we need to continue improving efficiency. And we know how to do that too. We also know that chemistry plays a crucial role in this #transformation. Because not only can we drastically reduce our own emissions, but also those of downstream supply chains that fuel almost all industries. And let's not forget that without chemistry there are no wind turbines, no solar panels, no electric cars, or building insulation. I'm proud of our industry for maintaining the focus on sustainability, even in the face of immense challenges like the pandemic and Russian war. We have a huge responsibility, and we take it on. If we speed up the expansion of renewable energies and open ourselves to new technologies and alternative raw materials.

His hashtag#empowerment motivated me to put all my energy into making this project a success. This experience of hashtag#trust has greatly shaped my journey as a hashtag#leader. I often hear or read questions as: Isn't it my job as a leader to tell staff what to do? Isn’t it my job to tell them how to do it?

The long-term success and health of a company is also gauged through the lens of #sustainability.  How an organization acts on matters of sustainability affects its ability to grow, access capital, attract talent, and enhance customer loyalty. For us at Allianz our strong financial performance and our commitments and contributions to shape a more sustainable future are inseparable. Guided by our purpose – “We Secure your Future” – sustainability is fundamental to the way we do business and the cornerstone of our success. Our new Sustainability Report, published today, reflects the work done across Allianz in 2022, in cooperation with our many partners, that helps build, grow, and protect more resilient lives, businesses, and economies.I am particularly proud of four aspects: ➡ Operational progress toward net-zero – We’ve set ambitious new commitments for our own operations, including a reinforced target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions arising from Allianz activities in over 70 markets to #netzero by 2030, with an aim to reach the 2050 goal earlier than originally planned. ➡ Our business strategies to deliver climate solutions, such as adjusting our thermal coal investment and underwriting strategy to be more inclusive of low-carbon energy efforts.➡ Education and job training, especially for the most vulnerable members of society. Through various initiatives such as the #MoveNow Training Series and Social Impact Fund, we help provide education and job training to vulnerable members of society, with a focus on preparing youth and people with disabilities for employment in a transitioning economy. ➡ Leadership and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion – we believe that a thriving work environment is one that is welcoming and inclusive. That’s why we prioritize gender equality and promote an inclusive culture along other dimensions, such as disability, nationalities/ethnicities, generations, and LGBTQ+. Our commitment is evidenced by our leading position in the Refinitiv Index for Diversity and Inclusion and in the German Diversity Index. I am also proud of Allianz being a #Valuable500 Iconic Leader company and part of the United Nations Women’s Empowerment Principles charter. I’m grateful to Allianz employees across the globe who work hard and are dedicated to managing our business sustainably.

Our review shows both highlights and lowlights. The market environment has been challenging for us and that is precisely why we have used 2022 to weatherproof ourselves. In the last year we have made our business at Gas and Power profitable again, we reorganized our company and worked hard to improve the performance at Siemens Gamesa (SGRE). Wind energy plays a key role in the energy transition and whilst we know that returning SGRE’s profitability will not happen overnight, it is a key focus for me personally to integrate the company’s employees and portfolio successfully. I am convinced that Siemens Energy has a successful future ahead of it. Our goal remains to support our customers in becoming more sustainable but also more resilient with regard to energy. We strive to be the leading energy technology company. In that respect, we will: 1. make our contribution to the environment and society🌍 2. train and qualify our employees to meet the demands and opportunities of the energy transition and 3. grow sustainably and create value for our shareholders.

In unserem Siemens Gamesa Werk für Offshore-Maschinenhäuser durfte ich Bundeswirtschafts- und Klimaschutzminister Robert Habeck zeigen, wie wir diese Energie einfangen und für Millionen von Menschen zur Verfügung stellen können.  Vor und während des Rundgangs durch unsere Fertigung haben wir uns über die große Aufgabe unterhalten, die uns mit dem Ausbau der hashtag#Windenergie bevorsteht. Vor einigen Jahren hätten wir die hashtag#Energiewende im gemütlichen Dauerlauf umsetzen können. Doch wir haben wertvolle Zeit verloren, während die Strecke vor uns dieselbe geblieben ist. Deshalb müssen wir jetzt zum Sprint anziehen. Denn in weniger als zehn Jahren müssen wir sowohl hashtag#Onshore als auch hashtag#Offshore noch einmal die gleiche Leistung installieren wie seit Beginn der Energiewende in den 1990er Jahren.  Wir können unsere Ziele im Kampf gegen die hashtag#Klimakrise nur dann erreichen, wenn Politik und die Herstellerinnen von Windenergieanlagen an einem Strang ziehen. Konkret:  🔷 Wir müssen jetzt sehr schnell von Zielsetzungen zu Umsetzungen kommen. Das Kabinett hat gestern wichtige Weichen zur Beschleunigung gestellt. Der Beschluss muss nun rasch vom Bundestag verabschiedet und von den Ländern umgesetzt werden. Auch bei den Flächenzielen für Onshore-Wind brauchen wir das Engagement der Länder.  🔷 Um Investitionssicherheit für dringend notwendige Kapazitäten zu schaffen, müssen aus Zielen Aufträge werden. Erst ein kleiner Teil von Offshore-Projekten befindet sich in den Händen von Entwicklern – und noch weniger in unseren Auftragsbüchern. Die Investitionsentscheidungen müssen aber jetzt getroffen werden – nicht nur bei uns, sondern auch bei Zulieferern, bei Häfen und Schiffen für die Installation. Eine zusätzliche Herausforderung ist dabei die enorme Ausbauwelle zum Ende der Dekade. Eine gleichmäßigere Verteilung der Volumina in Absprache mit den europäischen Nachbarn wäre hilfreich.  Bundesminister Habeck hat vieles in Bewegung gesetzt. Und das in einer Zeit, die kein Koalitionsvertrag so hat voraussehen können. Ich bin sehr dankbar für seinen Besuch heue und darüber, dass wir die Herausforderungen der Branche diskutieren konnten. Wir haben keine Zeit mehr zu verlieren, das muss allen bewusst sein.

At our Siemens Gamesa plant for offshore nacelles, I met with Germany’s Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck and showed him how we can capture this limitless source of energy. How we can make it available to millions of people.  Before and while touring our manufacturing facility, we talked about the task of massively expanding wind energy. A few years ago, we could have implemented the hashtag#EnergyTransition at a leisurely pace. But we’ve lost valuable time – and the way ahead has not gotten any shorter. That’s why we have to speed it up now. Because in less than ten years, we will have to install the same amount of power in Germany, both hashtag#onshore and hashtag#offshore, that we’ve installed since the 1990s.  We can only solve our hashtag#ClimateCrisis if politicians and wind turbine manufacturers work closely together. In concrete terms:  We now need to move very quickly from targets to implementation. Yesterday, the German cabinet took an important step toward accelerating wind expansion. That step must now be adopted by the Bundestag and implemented by the federal states. We also need the commitment of the federal states to the area targets for onshore wind.  We need to create investment security for urgently needed capacities by turning targets into orders. Only a small portion of offshore projects is in the hands of developers, even fewer projects are in our order books. But investment decisions have to be made now – not only by us but also by suppliers, and for the installation of wind turbines, by ports and ships. An additional challenge is the enormous expansion planned for the end of this decade. A more even distribution of volumes with our European neighbors would be helpful.  Robert Habeck has already set a lot in motion. And he has done so at a time that no government could have predicted. I am very grateful for his visit today. And for discussing the challenges facing the industry. We have no more time to lose, everyone must be aware of that.

Oliver Bäte,2023-01-30 08:47:10,Carousel,post,post,428,2,19,"When central banks raise interest rates, it creates ripple effects throughout the global economy. A recent Allianz Economic Research report helps quantify the significance of recent and upcoming rate hikes in the Eurozone and beyond, including the impact on government debt burdens.  I share the view that strong inflation dynamics will continue to put pressure on the European Central Bank and other central banks to keep interest rates elevated, in order to slow the rate of inflation.  So, what does this mean in terms of real impact on peoples’ lives? The answer is not simple. Elevated interest rates can affect individuals and businesses in different ways. This report from Allianz Research helps to raise awareness of the issue and explores the potential consequences that rate hikes may have on individuals and businesses alike. For example, commercial businesses that rely on debt funding may face some hardship. Many people may face further increases in their cost of living, while others may actually benefit from higher interest earnings on their savings accounts. Regardless of one’s financial circumstance, uncertainty abounds. And, in uncertain times, there can be a tendency to overestimate short-term impacts and underestimate the long-term effect. While current economic conditions may require a temporary tightening of the belt, for instance, it’s important to also not lose sight of long-term financial goals.  The future starts with financial literacy. I encourage you to explore the insight that Allianz Economic Research publishes regularly, designed to help individuals, businesses and investors better understand the economic issues impacting their financial decisions.

Despite many hurdles, the platform is on its way to becoming the hashtag#WindIndustry benchmark.  Over 150 wind turbines are now installed, and there will be roughly 1,000 when all 5 GW of installations are complete. These wind turbines will power over four million homes and help avoid over 13 million tons of CO2 emissions a year, benefitting the communities where we operate around the world both economically and environmentally. However, this achievement didn’t come easy.  We faced exceptional circumstances, ranging from the wind turbine’s development and production, to a global pandemic which led to severe supply chain constraints, rising inflation and shipping costs. Yet our teams navigated these challenges and developed an even more mature product in the process. Our engineers, for example, worked hard behind the scenes to make this the company’s fastest-selling hashtag#onshore wind turbine technology in operation today.  If the demand for onshore wind and the 5.X platform is as large as we expect, then we need to push for continued installations.

Immediate action is needed. There are three changes that will help to accelerate speed: 1. tangible deadlines2. simplification of processes, and3. adaption of solutions that already exist.  In vulnerable, hard-hit regions financing climate projects is also dependent on public lenders and governments opening their doors to collaboration. Governments alone can’t finance the high demand, but they can prioritize climate considerations in policymaking and work with finance partners on long-term development plans.

The first verdict of the past days: the theme is fitting. There is indeed a great willingness to cooperate among the various interest groups. Everyone is aware of the urgency to act. This is particularly true in the context of the energy transition, which is finally being seen not only as a challenge but also as an opportunity. 50 billion U.S. dollars in investment requirements by 2030 speak a clear language for this.  In the many discussion rounds, however, it also became clear that we will only achieve energy security if we make the energy system of the future affordable, reliable and sustainable. Sustainability is and must be at the center of an overarching concept of energy resilience – and we can only achieve this together.  Very positive highlight: The EU – especially in the person of Ursula von der Leyen – as well as other regions have made a strong commitment to further accelerate the energy transition and the cleantech sector. The industry stands ready. However, it must also be a matter of giving special support to economic sectors that are not healthy, such as wind power. Only if we jointly address the framework conditions and improve auction mechanisms, for example, will we be able to remain competitive in an inflationary environment at present. Also high on the agenda is making mineral supply chains resilient. After all, they are a fundamental prerequisite for accelerating the energy transition. My conclusion these days is: much can be done, some has already been achieved, but much more work is needed. In this sense, the World Economic Forum was a good springboard to move some of the issues forward. hashtag#WEF hashtag#WEF23 hashtag#Davos Siemens Energy",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7021849112408944640

More attention needs to be paid to attracting and training the wind-industry workforce. 🔷  And there needs to be a build-out of new hashtag#TransmissionInfrastructure and clean-energy projects at an unprecedented scale. And for that, project developers will need greater certainty on permitting timelines. But it’s not only about what government can do. We, the wind industry, also have a lot of work to do. That includes rebalancing the existing cost-sharing structure across stakeholders who are behind the build-out of the industry. This would help tackle the unequal distribution of risk between developers and manufacturers, which in the wind industry is unlike anything seen in other industries.

Jochen Eickholt,2022-12-22 19:08:22,Text + Photo,post,post,686,8,17,"✔️ 2022 ends with good news for hashtag#WindEnergy: Earlier this week, the EU’s energy ministers agreed on emergency rules to accelerate the permitting of renewable projects. We at Siemens Gamesa welcome the leadership of the European institutions and EU member states. These new permitting rules fulfill the promise of the hashtag#REPowerEU plan launched in May, which declared hashtag#renewables a matter of “overriding public interest.”  Why is faster permitting so important?  🎯 The REPowerEU plan to install 510 gigawatts (GW) of wind energy by 2030 is ambitious (today’s installed capacity is at 190 GW). But time and again, the European hashtag#wind industry has proven that it can get the job done. We are ready to turn installation targets into reality. The issue is that projects get stuck in different permitting stages. These long permit-granting processes result in a mismatch between the targeted renewable volumes and reality. Across Europe, a cumulative 80 GW in wind projects are currently stuck in different hashtag#permitting stages (compared with 190 GW in operation). As installed capacity, these additional gigawatts could have helped to minimize the current geopolitical impact on energy security in Europe. 🤝🏻 That is why closer collaboration between public and private stakeholders is necessary. We all need to work closely together: international institutions, governments, non-governmental organizations – and members of the entire value chain of renewables (including developers, off takers, original equipment manufacturers, suppliers of components, etc.). That is how we can turn targets into clean gigawatts. And that is how we stand a chance in curbing climate change and achieving hashtag#EnergySovereignty. Because installed wind energy will help reduce energy bills, create sustainable jobs, foster entrepreneurship, and incentivize further technological breakthroughs. What will follow this week’s agreement? ⚖️ The emergency measures on permitting will be in force for 18 months. In a few weeks from now, the EU member states and the European parliament will begin negotiations on a final text of the revised renewables directive. We are hoping this directive will turn the recently approved emergency measures into ambitious and binding targets. Because we all need a strong European wind industry. 👏🏻 To quote the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen: “Supporting the clean transition is the right thing to do, if you are doing it right. In a transparent manner. In a spirit of cooperation. And in a way that ensures a level playing field. It should be a race against time. Not against each other”. 🙌🏻 That’s the spirit we need going forward. That is how 2023 can become the year of renewables. Let’s seize this opportunity, this moment of hashtag#WindNow.

Ein Jahr, das kein Koalitionsvertrag so hat voraussehen können. „hashtag#Energiesouveränität“ steht seit dem verbrecherischen Angriffskrieg Russlands auf die Ukraine ganz oben auf der politischen Agenda. Vieles wurde in Bewegung gesetzt, auch für den Ausbau von Windenergie. Die Grundlagen sind geschaffen für mehr Tempo, das wir jetzt dringend brauchen. Wo also steht die Windenergie in Deutschland? Und wo muss sie hin? Onshore- und Offshore-Wind 🔷 Erstmals gibt es ein gesetzlich verankertes Ziel für die Bereitstellung von Flächen an Land. Zwei Prozent der Bundesfläche soll für den hashtag#Windausbau zur Verfügung stehen. Die Länder stellen dazu ihre Flächen zur Verfügung, haben allerdings noch bis 2027 Zeit (bzw. final bis 2032) für die endgültige Ausweisung. Heute sind 0,8 Prozent der Bundesfläche ausgewiesen. Mehr Tempo ist geboten.🔷 Viele hashtag#Rahmenbedingungen wurden auf Bundesebene angepasst. Der Ausbau der Windenergie liegt jetzt im überragenden öffentlichen Interesse und dient der öffentlichen Sicherheit. Damit sollen Ausbauhürden auf rechtlichem Weg beiseite geräumt werden. Wir brauchen aber auch ganz praktisch weitere Anstrengungen bei der Ausstattung der Genehmigungsbehörden oder bei der Vereinfachung von Schwerlasttransporten, um den Ausbau tatsächlich beschleunigen zu können. 🔷 Die große Herausforderung bei der Windenergie auf See wird sein, die Industriekapazitäten nach der Ausbaulücke der vergangenen Jahre nachhaltig wieder zu steigern. Ein gleichmäßiger Ausbau ist dafür essenziell. Mit 17 Gigawatt Ausbau zum Ende der Dekade steuern wir auf einen Ausbauhype zu. Aktuell gibt es hierfür noch keine hashtag#Planungssicherheit durch Auftragseingang bei der Industrie, um die notwendigen Investitionen anzustoßen. Sowohl bei den Turbinenherstellern, der Zulieferindustrie als auch bei den Häfen sind massive Investitionen erforderlich, um die Ziele erreichen zu können.  Fazit: 🔷 Die Zielsetzungen zum Ausbau und die Beschleunigung von Verfahren sind ein guter Anfang.🔷 Die besondere Bedeutung von Windenergie können wir nur dann untermauern, wenn wir von Zielsetzungen zu schnellen Umsetzungen kommen. 🔷 Um die Ziele zu erreichen, brauchen wir vereinfachte und schnellere Verfahren für Projekte.🔷 Während die Regelung zur Verfügbarkeit von Flächen an Land gut ist, muss sie schneller umgesetzt werden.   In weniger als zehn Jahren müssen wir das schaffen, wofür wir seit dem Beginn der Energiewende mehrere Jahrzehnte gebraucht haben.

Jochen Eickholt,2022-12-07 08:48:29,Link post,post,post,544,12,10,"There is “unprecedented momentum for hashtag#renewables,” according to the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s “Renewables 2022” report. They claim that from 2022-2027, “renewables are seen growing by almost 2,400 GW, equal to the entire installed power capacity of China today – an 85% acceleration from the previous five years.” Here’s the issue: According to the report, by the end of that period hashtag#onshore wind is only expected to break its annual installation record set in 2020. That’s much too slow, and it’s a result of lengthy hashtag#permitting processes and a lack of improvement to grid hashtag#infrastructures. When it comes to Europe and hashtag#offshore wind, the challenges aren’t any fewer: Europe’s share of overall installed offshore capacity is expected to decline from 50% in 2021 to 30% in 2027.  That aside, there is much to be optimistic about in the IEA’s report, but it also only confirms what the European wind industry has been asking hashtag#policymakers for, namely: ▪ simplified and faster permitting processes, which have to apply to both new and pending projects;▪ grid investments and transparent grid-access rules; and▪ an overall European industrial policy that creates the right framework conditions.

Government policy plays an important role, but so does the private sector. Often there is a misconception that private capital is not available to fund the development needed to make vulnerable countries more climate resilient. In fact, there’s plenty of untapped private capital – and expertise – available. And many institutional investors want to invest their capital into green economy projects in emerging markets. The issue is not capital availability, it’s risk and how to manage it. To bring more attention to this issue, I recently collaborated with Makhtar Diop, Managing Director at IFC - International Finance Corporation, on a feature that explores the climate project opportunities in emerging markets. One example of this is the Allianz- and IFC-funded program, ‘Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Platform One Planet’, which connected global institutional investors and enabled up to $3 billion of new financing for climate projects in countries that need them the most. It is our hope that this project and similar ones, such as the Emerging Market Climate Action Fund, will serve as a guide for private capital mobilization at scale in emerging and developing markets.

As we begin to move out of the 2022 hurricane season and take stock of its impact, it is worth reflecting on longer-term implications and the role of our industry in managing them.  The insurance industry has a direct view into the devastating consequences of hurricanes and other extreme weather events, such as floods, which are likely to increase in frequency and severity with climate change. As a result, we must play a central role in climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience – not just because it makes good business sense, but because it makes the world more livable for everyone. At Allianz, we take this responsibility seriously. First, we constantly work to develop new products and services to respond to climate change. Our Allianz Climate Change Risk Solutions, for instance, quantify changes in expected damages to our insurance and investment portfolios due to physical climate change impacts. This helps inform how we support our customers in building resilience and our own long-term investment decisions, thereby lowering risk over time.  Second, we collaborate with experts in academia. Our annual Allianz Climate Research Risk Award, for example, identifies research that advances better understanding of and adapt to climate change.  Third, we support public private partnerships, such as via the UK Build Back Better Scheme. These partnerships aim to cover high-risk areas with affordable premiums via pool solutions, which also enable investments in resiliency measures.  We can’t hold back the storms, but we can fortify our resilience to them. Through innovation, collaboration, and economies of scale, we can rebuild our world in a new and more sustainable image.

Here are underlying fundamentals that matter: ➡ Our Group customer dNPS results, which measure our customers’ likelihood to recommend us to others and are linked to better business outcomes, overachieved our company targets this year.  ➡ Allianz’s global brand is again the highest-ranked insurance brand in the world according to Interbrand, and the 11th fastest growing brand of all sectors; today our Allianz brand is worth more than $18 billion, having increased by more than $3.5 billion in the past year alone.  ➡ A healthy and engaged workforce is among the most powerful competitive advantages that our company can have. Our recent annual Allianz Engagement Survey confirmed this conviction with feedback from more than 112,000 colleagues across the world. We achieved our best results to date, with our industry-leading scores on IMIX (Inclusive Meritocracy) and WWI+ (Work Well) indices at an all-time high.  ➡ The Dow Jones Sustainability Index again recognized us as a sustainable insurer with a very strong 89/100 rating amid a strengthening competitive set and ever higher standards. All of these factors reflect an overall strong state of stakeholder trust, which is earned every day by our hard-working Allianz colleagues. As we celebrate the earnings results announced today and look ahead to achieving our operating target by year end, it will be how we work as a team, how we serve our customers, and how we invest in our people that will determine our success.

Manas Human,2022-11-09 18:13:36,Text + Album,post,post,1603,25,30,"Rituals embed culture. One ritual at Nagarro is our leadership conflux (conflux: Latin for “where rivers merge”). The conflux has no theme, no topics, no working sessions, no breakout groups, no team-building exercises, no target-setting, not even any opening or closing speeches. The conflux gives everyone 10 minutes to speak to the group, whenever they want, on any subject at all. Some people even recite poetry or do some standup. Just humans being humans. The only hard rule is the 10 minutes.The participants come from all over the world and may be meeting after a year or more. Some may even be all-new, perhaps having joined us via an acquisition. So you may think the conflux might be erratic, arbitrary and directionless. It is none of that. It flows like a poem. The speakers riff off what went before, they adapt in real-time, and patterns emerge. There is showmanship but also honesty - with many acknowledging their vulnerabilities and frustrations. By the time the conflux winds down, there’s a feeling that nothing important has been left unsaid. We leave energized and each one has their own takeaways.Why this conflux format? In a regular meetup, alpha personalities may drown out other voices. Even the choice of topics to be discussed may become a power play. So we invented this simple format eight years ago and have watched it work like a charm ever since. Company politics is like a termite infestation. It is best avoided.In fact, the real business of the conflux is at the breakfasts, the lunches, the coffee breaks, the dinners and long parties afterwards. This year, I went to bed at 3 am, 4 am and 5 am on the three dinner nights. Somewhere in between the drinks, the bad singing and the poor jokes, we had been making good friends.Since 2019, we have expanded our leadership conflux with the participants of the rotating Glass Window diversity program. This year, we went further and live-streamed the entire event, making it available to everyone in the company. Several thousand Nagarrians tuned in live, which may be a first for a (near-)billion dollar company.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6996172959698567168

As a member of the World Economic Forum’s Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, I endorse the open letter that we have shared for world leaders at hashtag#COP27 – aiming to foster cooperation and shared responsibility between the private and public sectors. Business needs to work side-by-side with government to deliver bold climate action, and is already doing so effectively in many cases. We encourage all business leaders to halve global emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. At Allianz, we are driving that change. We will limit our greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2030. And as a founding member of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), we are committed to transitioning investment portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050. Accelerating the transition to net zero also requires cooperation between developed and developing countries. The good news is that the capital to fund that transition is available.

Rather, mental health issues are very common. Maybe that will help you a bit - the knowledge that there is nothing unusual about your issues. This knowledge definitely helps me.I have had my years of depression and still remain faintly bipolar. I still wake up many mornings either somewhat depressed or slightly manic. That mood often lasts the entire day, or at least the management of the mood lasts the entire day.Over the years, I have discovered the five simple factors can trigger depression in me: sleep (too little), alcohol (too much), exercise (too little), water (too little) and food (too much). While the factors appear trivial, the depression which they create is heavy and painful. But it helps to know that this depression is not ""real"" in the sense that some more sleep or some more exercise will fix it.External mechanisms can also trigger depressive moods in me: 1) Being in a situation where I helplessly wait for someone else to make a decision that will affect me a lot. 2) Having some important and unpleasant chunk of work due some time later, not so soon that I have to get working on it but soon enough that it starts to eat me up with worry. 3) And of course, one gets depressed if one sees a loved one struggling in some way.This categorization of issues works for me. It helps me look at my mood rationally and understand what is driving it. I am not an expert on this topic, nor do I want to hold this approach out as a solution. Rather, I'm sharing this with the POV that if we talk about how we deal with our mental health issues, it will help remove the unnecessary and silly taboo that is still associated with them.",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6985116404995776512

Soaring energy costs are fueling inflation and putting significant financial pressure on households around the globe. And according to the just-released Fall Global Economic Outlook by Ludovic Subran and the Allianz Research team, inflation is expected to remain elevated into 2023.  Today’s challenging economic situation calls for new tools and innovative thinking by governments and businesses alike. One perspective I found to be particularly innovative, can be found in the recent Allianz Research article on averting a ‘Gasmageddon’. This is the idea of introducing a new “energy money” benefit whereby households make payments to an “energy savings account” in which the amounts are partially saved and then topped up by the state. This would encourage a reduction in energy usage and help support the build-up of financial reserves – particularly important for lower and middle-income households who are most feeling the brunt of inflation.  Particularly in times of rising economic and political instability, business as usual is not the answer. Swift and forward-looking action by both the private sector and policymakers alike is needed. By working together, we can create innovative solutions that transcend short-term thinking, help grow the middle class, and stabilize democracies around the globe.

I was particularly pleased to accept this invitation because I am convinced of the importance of balanced, well researched, and fact-based journalism to build trust in an increasingly polarized world.  According to the Edelman Trust Barometer, only 51% of Germans have trust in media, and globally, 46% of people see media as a dividing force in society. These views on media become even starker when seen through the lens of income, with those in the lower brackets less trustful of media in general.  Lower income citizens, particularly in Germany, are losing trust in their societal institutions overall compared to their higher income counterparts. This is a critical signal that we need to address. Under the current economic pressures that we now face in Germany, ensuring the well being of our lower income population -- without overly taxing our country’s potential to meet future challenges – will prevent the internal divisions that currently undermine many democratic nations. Creative solutions for affordable housing, retirement security, and healthcare are required, and the private and public sectors must be willing to collaborate in new ways to deliver better outcomes for people.  A free press that respects the intelligence of the reader makes democratic institutions stronger. A free press is also the foundation of a fair and free market. Congratulations to the Börsen-Zeitung on its anniversary.

It is also why we have underwritten a survey, conducted by Edelman DxI, examining the state of trust in the US-German partnership. This survey highlights the role that our business and government sectors can play together in tackling the biggest issues that our world faces today.The current arc of crisis - threats to democracy, war, inflation, fears of recession, concerns about the climate - makes it imperative that the two spheres work closely together. It is the outcomes, the concrete improvements in people's lives, that make them advocate one form of government or another. It's about solutions that work. To this end, businesses and governments must join forces to inspire people with reasons to believe in free and open societies, especially as authoritarian regimes expand.There is much power to be unleashed in public-private cooperation across both nations, and there is more we can do together:- The private sector can help to deliver decarbonization outcomes by transforming their businesses in line with climate goals.- It takes two strong partners to face the fact that the rising costs of living are undermining the economic security of our middle classes and threaten our political stability -- and manage these pressures accordingly.- We must also join forces to prevent media from being a source of discord. This is a matter of an overarching culture of self-responsibility that also ensures that a lie has consequences for the person who knowingly tells it. Just as in business, where someone who does the wrong thing does not last long. This is a matter of holding leaders to account, and it's also a question of responsibly regulating social media.In building trust, we build a bridge. This is a bridge that connects our peoples. But, as we look forward, we also have to use the bridge of trust to connect our singular advantages on each side of the Atlantic to the benefit of the world.It is time for an invigorated German-American partnership.I encourage you to take a look at the full survey found here: https://bit.ly/3tBTxjA....hashtag#USA hashtag#Germany hashtag#business hashtag#climatechange",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6942342717699985408

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has brought this issue into stark focus. Europe relies on large volumes of imported oil and gas from Russia, and it's this dependence that threatens to expose our governments, businesses, and communities to volatilities in supply and pricing.  Wind energy is needed to decarbonize and secure our electricity supply. Yet, it is also required to power the production of green hydrogen, a clean fuel for hard-to-electrify industries. These energy-intensive industries are big consumers of imported fossil fuels, and green hydrogen is the only viable alternative to cut these greenhouse gas emissions. Accelerating the production of renewable energy was already on the agenda before the invasion began. It’s now an imperative.

I’ve really enjoyed seeing the sites in action, and meeting some of the inspiring people who make Siemens Gamesa a leading innovator in the wind industry. My first stop was our remote control center and research and development headquarters based in Pamplona, Spain. The remote control center operates round the clock, monitoring 9,000 turbines in 450 wind farms around the world. It uses advanced digitalization techniques, making use of data such as blade inclination and wind speed to troubleshoot any faults and fix them remotely. The center’s activities are essential to our global operations. I was impressed by the activity of our team of 30 colleagues who have worked onsite throughout the pandemic to keep our turbines functioning.  In addition, I visited our nacelle plant in Ágreda, Spain. The site is one of our major export centers for nacelles and is also a key manufacturing hub for our new generation of Siemens Gamesa 5.X turbines. My visit ended with a trip to our onshore blade factory in Vagos, Portugal, today. The site is the largest of its kind in Europe and, much like our nacelle plant in Ágreda, is a central export hub for international markets.  Throughout the week, I have been struck by the passion and technological expertise of the people at our sites, and their dedication to taking wind energy to the next level.

It has been enormously encouraging to meet so many customers, suppliers and peers from across our diverse and vibrant sector.  What has struck me is the clear determination that exists across our industry to ensure that wind is recognized as a major contributor to both the energy transition and strengthening global energy security.  While those of us in the industry recognize the huge potential of wind, and the major contribution it is already making to securing the net zero economy, we need to be clear-sighted about the challenges that lie ahead.  We cannot be complacent in thinking the arguments in favor of wind have been won.  Nor can we ignore the turmoil in the supply chain that must be resolved if the industry is to achieve its ambitions.  We need be relentless in communicating the benefits of wind energy, both offshore and onshore, to policy-makers, politicians, communities, investors and businesses day-in day-out. We need to act fast and lobby hard for the policies and frameworks that will unlock a healthy and sustainable wind sector, which is vital to building a greener and cleaner future.  Let's resolve to work together in partnership to: - Drive up the volume of permitted projects.- Simplify and standardize permitting processes at a national level.- Focus on grid expansion and the infrastructure needed for storage and renewable hydrogen - Reward the value of wind in auction design, recognizing its contribution to jobs, skills and innovation.

Alongside the present and real threat of climate changes, it is time for all of us in the renewables industry to step up to the challenges of today.  We know that wind energy is a cost-effective and efficient solution to drive down carbon emissions. We know that onshore and offshore wind energy can strengthen energy independence, reducing Europe’s dependency on imported fossil fuels which still accounts for 58% of its energy needs. We know that the renewables sector supports the green economy, generating new sources of growth, long-term job creation and the revitalization of communities. However, there are still roadblocks to fulfilling its potential. And with the huge problems we in the supply chain are facing, we need to be honest about the challenges we face in building a health and sustainable industry. So, I was pleased today to be able to address colleagues in the industry and the policy makers who determine the environment in which we work at the opening session of WindEurope´s annual event in Bilbao today. We all have an interest in creating a resilient and sustainable industry in Europe. Doing so requires clear and determined steps forward, and I put forward a number of points for consideration.  Firstly, in Europe, we need to increase market volumes rapidly. To meet EU targets for 2030, we need to build 30 GW of new wind capacity every year, and yet last year we only built 11 GW. Unless we drive up the volume of permitted projects, we will place unsustainable cost pressure on manufacturers and suppliers.  Secondly, national targets have increased across the EU, which is great. But the lack of ambition around permitting stands in the way of those targets. Unless we simplify and standardize permitting processes at a national level we will fail to deliver on those targets.  Thirdly, we need to focus on infrastructure. We need to speed up the planning, permitting and building of grids as grid expansion is a prerequisite for more renewable energy. And we need to think ahead to the infrastructure required for storage and for renewable hydrogen to avoid future bottlenecks.  And finally, we need to rewarding the value of wind in auction design. To strengthen the global competitiveness of the European wind industry, we need to reward the value that it brings in terms of R&D, job and skills development, and innovative, sustainability solutions such as recyclable blades.  By working together, now is the time to address the challenges that stand in the way of a healthy and sustainable wind industry, that is so vital for building a secure, net zero global economy.  hashtag#WindEurope2022 hashtag#windenergy hashtag#energytransition",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6917137081404137472

Financial market players take refuge in unproductive investments such as gold or real estate - instead of investing in young companies and new technologies. Only one party is pleased: highly indebted countries – since their debts are also depreciating in value.  The announcements made yesterday by the Federal Reserve are good news for everyone.

This is the time to get started, and the AOA – referred to as the “gold standard” by UN Secretary General António Guterres - is leading the way.  🌎🌏🌍 ....hashtag#climatechange hashtag#decarbonization hashtag#ESG hashtag#sustainability hashtag#racetonetzero hashtag#climateprotection hashtag#allianz hashtag#financialIndustry",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6870047369166254080
